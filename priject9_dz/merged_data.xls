after having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of imdb for pushing daisies and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode i thought it was about time i said what i thought of pdfirst off to address what some of the issues that i have seen other people having with this show something along the lines of i expect the people who have been woken from the dead to have a more realistic reaction realistic on this show pushing daisies is truly pure and utter escapism its colour palette the dialogue used the scenarios situations music all of it to me is just an escape from everyday life an escape from the mundane and boring it is here where pushing daisies exceeds exceptionally well pushing daisies isnt for everyone a large majority of the television audience dont get it for some people its just too out there and silly but for people like me even from the first episode i watched of it season 2s frescorts and i was just blown away by the show from then on i bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my dvd player other people i know cant stand it it really seems to be like marmitethe show follows the adventures of ned the piemaker with a magic finger who brings back childhood sweetheart charlotte charles works in association with private investigator emerson cod owns the piehole and employs waitress olive snook completing the main cast members are aunts lily and vivian whom charlotte chuck is never allowed to see they live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour and narrated by jim daleother than outlining the basics of the show i really cant praise it much more without saying just watch it despite being screwed over by the writers guild of america strike with only 22 episodes ever to be made it provides wonderful plot twists story lines characters and situations while providing for me a satisfying ending yes i could tell it had been tacked on the end and rushed but i was still happy with the way it went out whether it is creative or just pretentious for a lot of people me included it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing and i hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so im not left with just 22 40 minute memories of what true entertainment can be,1,-1,positive,1.0

of the many problems with this film the worst is continuity and reediting it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing how much longer to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriouslythats staggering what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here their previous film white zombie was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films the mummy dracula etc and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazinesrevolt of the zombies to the contrary appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war this would not only explain the opening and the change of dean jaggers character into a megalomaniac but it also explains why the zombies dont actually do much in the film besides stand around look frightening and wait for orders theyre just allegorical soldiers not the undead cannibals weve all come to love and loathe in zombie filmsi am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics but i think a film ought to be entertaining first and only later maybe educational and definitely a film about zombies ought to be about zombiestruly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history but not one i can recommend even for historic value,0,0,positive,0.0
jeremy irons and forrest whitaker are good actors but this movie was badly written first of all during the hijack scene irons sits too comfortably in his chairhe appears to be reading something and rather calmly too perhaps the director shot the actor in between takes also the violence at the hijacking was a big letdown slowmo bullets flyinghow his wife and daughter get killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost his grieving afterward wasted another 10 minutes then he decided to get revenge and talk to all his industry journalist friends and ambassadors hes a journalist for the stuffy economist rag and lo and behold they actually give him tips on where to find the bad guys how do they know but what really made me turn the movie off halfway through was when irons finds his way into a warehouse where baddies are hanging outbut not the baddies who killed his wifeand blows them away anyway so hes just a murderer he gets away and welli shut it off i mean i couldnt figure out how his friends knew anything and also i thought he was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original hijackers instead hes going after their friends i guess or anyone who hangs out in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons laying around the suspense was just totally conventional and the dialog was lame its ok son crying helps he says to his son son says no it doesnt and father says youre rightit doesntirons takes on questionable roleslike that one dragon movie he did he was excellent in brideshead revisited which is a completely different animal than this lukewarm thriller,0,-1,positive,0.0
by 1945 and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces errol flynns hold over us box office had started to decline so in spite of the increased burden of waning looks he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler the first of these was a good one actually adventures of don juan 1948 but it also proved to be his last bigbudget hollywood starring vehicle the rest of his swordwielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim 1950 the master of ballantrae 1953 and the dark avenger 1955 in france for adventures of captain fabian 1951 and italy for the aborted the story of william tell 1953 and the littleseen crossed swords 1954 however hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways albeit for a modestlybudgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers a production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak still the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self his redheaded leading lady maureen ohara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady anthony quinn was still a few years away from his largerthanlife starring vehicles so here he is typically seen as the baddie the pirate captain roc brasiliano a role he attacks with gusto like the black shield of falworth 1954 a viewing of which preceded this one against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channelsfor all i know this might well have been the very first pirate movie ive ever seen and i cringe at the thought of todays generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about as i said earlier against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but its a solid example of this prolific genre all the same nowadays the amorous persistence of the childlike indian princess alice kelley towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk 1940 and the black swan 1942 to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars is briskly paced and reasonably engaging incidentally the film would later go on to be remade as the kings pirate 1967 with doug mcclure for what its worth the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and as a matter of fact against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorlythought out pirates of the golden age movie collection set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneers girl 1950 with yvonne de carlo doule crossbones 1951 with donald oconnor and yankee buccaneer 1952 with jeff chandler value for money perhaps but so far i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so if the mood strikes me in future i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyks mutiny 1952 the aforementioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga 1961,1,0,negative,1.0
i first watched the walking tall movies when i was about 8 years old and i thought both joe don baker and bo svenson did a great job they must have anyway because since watching the movies i have tried to learn as much about the real sheriff buford pusser as i can all 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and buford pusser was a true hero i only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him i would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave i am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain my heart goes out to them so from a 30 year old fan of sheriff pusser and of the 3part walking tall movies and the actors that portrayed him please do not be negative about these movies and actors they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real buford pusser was and what a great family he had and to all the young people who may have not heard much about buford i suggest you watch the walking tall movies and learn more about him,1,1,positive,1.0

much better than it is generally given credit for this version of lost horizon not only had great music and beautiful scenery but also some stunning mountain photography a special edition laser disc was released some years ago which added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material extra music and lots of bonus material so why isnt this on dvd hard to figure the studios out sometimes certainly the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than peter finch liv ullman george kennedy and sally kellerman but what do you want in a movie good acting or melodious pipes song and dance man bobby van is great fun michael york is a suitably tragic villain and seeing sir john gielgud decked out as chang may sound silly but actually works very well on screen trust me you need to check this movie out if you can find it,1,1,positive,1.0
im a fan of the old sctv show from the late 70s and early 80s and john candy was a major reason why he was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious unfortunately he could not get these roles to play in the movies time after time i was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the straight role instead of the funny guy armed and dangerous rarely tries to use johns comedic abilities or that of harold ramis for that matter it is simply a very predictable cops and robbers type of movie if you are a john candy or harold ramis fan the movie is watchable just dont expect to laugh much,0,-1,neutral,0.0

it really was that bad on a par with the mercifully shortlived dirty dozen tv series that starred ben murphy and was made at around the same time also on the cheap in yugoslaviai was embarrassed for the cast members of this film and for telly savalas in particular he was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role pushing 70 when he made this garbage and the reviewer who draws parallels with telly the greek in this and john wayne in the green berets pretty much sums it upother reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains so i wont repeat them here but i will add that im amazed that noones yet mentioned the ridiculously tinylooking helmet that savalas wears on his big bloated head im also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as 47 here at imdbas far as im concerned its a 1 right across the board if you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a bad idea especially 20plus years after the original look no further than the dirty dozen the fatal missionawful avoid,0,0,negative,0.0

its a genuine shame that this spinoff tv series inspired by the superior madefortv pictures the night stalker and the night strangler only lasted a single season and twenty episodes because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor carl kolchaks spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and longsuffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear clever writing nifty supernatural menaces gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in the spanish moss murders the sentry and horror in the heights plus you cant go wrong with such triedntrue fright favorites as zombies vampires werewolves and witches colorful characters lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in the energy eater while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like keenan wynn john fiedler john dehner severn darden and william daniels in juicy roles effective moments of genuine suspense the sewerset climax of the spanish moss murders in particular was truly harrowing and best of all the one and only darren mcgavin in peak zesty form as the brash aggressive and excitable but basically decent brave and honest smalltime chicago illinois newspaper reporter carl kolchakkolchak was the quintessential 70s everyman protagonist a wily and quickwitted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble moreover the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but superhuman he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters simon oakland was perfect as carls chronically illtempered boss tony vincenzo jack grinnage as the prissy ron updyke made for an ideal comic foil ruth mcdevitt was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily cowles and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie monique marmelstein who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes granted the show did suffer from lackluster makeup and special effects the titular lycanthrope in the werewolf unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters the headless motorcyclist in chopper cathy lee crosby as helen of troy in the youth killer but even the secondrate shows are redeemed by the programs trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and mcgavins boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence,1,1,positive,1.0

this movie was terrible the acting was awful the script was awful what was even worse were the camera shots and sound half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues the worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge crossshaped building the building had to have been 50 stories high and probably 100 feet wide however when the actor was on top of it in another shot they had recreated the top of the building the buildings width had been reduced to about eight feet wide how could a building hundreds of feet high be eight feet wide i know the film was low budget but it is inexcusable the movie itself just pushed ideas about a rapture then actually having a storyline or point this reduced the script to mere rubbish the characters seemed to be selling ideas in their lines rather than conveying emotions and moving the movie along in a direction it was a complete waste of time watching the movie gives christians a bad name if it is one of the current best christian films out there,0,0,positive,0.0
for those of you whove never heard of it or seen it on ae cracker is a brilliant british tv show about an overweight chainsmoking foulmouthed psychologist named fitz who helps the manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals its considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of england and thats saying something and was tremendously successful in england and around the world back in 1993now the original stars have reteamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2hour episode ive loved this show ever since id first seen it over a decade ago the dvd box set holds a place of honor in my collection and i can quote a good deal of fitzs interrogation scenes practically word for word the idea of robbie coltrane reteaming with jimmy mcgovern for another tv movie about fitz filled me with absolute gleeill start with the good one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series was how quickly fitz was defined as a character five minutes into the first episode with his lecture throwing the books into the air his drinking and his cussing of the guy after him on the gambling machine queue and you knew simply knew who this character was you could feel him clicking in your mind the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writercoltrane of course remained great throughout the show but i always felt that some of the later episodes those not written by mcgovern mistreated the characterso the good news is this fitz is back as soon as you see him in this show making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughters wedding youll feel that click once again its him petulant one moment and truly sorry the next always insightful sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process if you love this character as much as i do youll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie and this extends to judith and mark in fact everything having to do with the fitzs is handled perfectlythe problem i do have with this movie revolves around the crime fitz is trying to solve in standard cracker fashion we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes the suspense lies in seeing fitz figure it out in this case we have a serial killer who is out for american blood and the reason for this unfortunately is not due to any believable psychological trauma rather it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefsits difficult for me to write this as i truly believe that jimmy mcgovern is one of the greatest writers in the world nor do i have a problem with movies that are about current issues or movies that take a political stand but in the cracker universe we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings not like caricatures instead the americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion theyre knownothing loudmouths who complain about everything treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes i honestly thought id mistakenly switched channels or somethingbut it doesnt stop there we get constant reminders of just how badly the war in iraq is going reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere the killer is so busy ranting about how bush is worse than hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing but more to the point he is such a mouthpiece for the writers political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being and thus we as an audience dont buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serialkilling souli cant say that this ruined the show for me its was still good tv better than almost everything else in the genre mainly due to once again coltrane but its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real cracker classics like to be a somebody an episode that was just as issuey but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depthtwo other small points panhandle not being around is a disappointment but whats worse are her replacements the entire police department which for so long filled with such great characters is now full of vanilla completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality how you could drain couplings richard coyle of personality is beyond me but it is indeed missing herealso there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me one such instance revolves around fitz having to narrow down the entire population of manchester from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria french windows how does the computer know if i have french windows he not only succeeds in doing this but he succeeds in less than an hour i dont think soso all in all i was a little disappointed its recommended viewing but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door still if theres new series to come after this it would all have been for the good im convinced that mcgovern can still write great stuff and maybe now that hes got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people,0,1,positive,0.0

of all the versions of the odyssey or of any greek mythological story for that matter this in my opinion is the best of them all almost true to the original storyline with some minor deviations and omissions eg the absence of scylla charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiecenot some hollywoodish swordandsandal bflick notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand at least i did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more,1,-1,positive,1.0

i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that ive seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90s horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being selfmocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here this is the perfect blend of 80s and 90s horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90s films and the stalkingslasher madness of an 80s flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right directiondenise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie,1,-1,positive,1.0
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more miscast is ida lupino in the leading role lupino a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange is here under the illusion she is rita hayworth playing the part of a sexy barroom torch singer handsome cornel wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented celeste holm whos role is little more than a bit part then we have richard widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture when we first see him he is a nice ok guy who runs a thriving road house then suddenly and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear he becomes insanely jealous of his manager wilde when the latter tells him that he is about to marry lupino you see widmark wanted to marry her himself but 1 he never proposed to her 2 they never had a relationship they dont even have anything that resembles a love scene together and 3without telling anyone including lupino he has obtained a marriage license wow so how widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with lupino after such a courtship is anybodys quess huh well when widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie i am sorry to say from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing he finally goes over the edge becomes completely deranged and with a few tommy udo sniggers he laughably goes gunning for poor cornel wilde before biting the dust himselfand if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors theres not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie added to this 95 of the film takes place at nightbesides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette widmark lupino at fox whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me as far as i know they were never before together in a movie at fox or anywhere else however this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter knowalls as robert osborne eddie muller rudy belhmer and a few others who amazingly heap praise on this wearisome and cringe inducing affair all i can say then it must be me i guess but road house up to now was a forgotten and buried noir and as far as i am concerned it should have remained sofox would do better if they issued dvds of superior and thus far elusive widmark movies like down to the sea in ships 1949 and the colourful red skies of montana 1952,0,1,positive,0.0

those of you who like me were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn the fear will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel it sort of follows a similar plot but it is impossible to connect to the original with the exception of the presence of morty the mannequin monster made of wood here is a brief overviewtwenty years after mike hawthorne gordon currie in a decent performance witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life mike is still suffering from the fear of that day in hopes of ridding his fear mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents home his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears and then present the fears to the mannequin morty according to an indian friend this process is supposed to magically take away ones fear what mike doesnt know is that morty is possessed with his fathers spirit and begins killing off the friendsor is it really mike himself doing the killings who caresa have a few troubles with this film the first lies with morty i thought the original made morty look rather convincing this time it is painfully obvious morty is a man actor jon fedele in a fake looking suit this can especially be seen in early scenes where morty is still supposed to be inanimate but if you watch closely you can see him blinking another trouble is that most of the characters dont try hard enough some of them do namely betsy palmer of friday the 13th fame who was excellent in this film but most of them dont make the effort or werent given the chance finally there are the killings the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing actually when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie when the second half of the movie arrives and the killings really start everything falls to pieces deaths are either uncreative unseen or foreseen glimpses of the next scene as currie has a blackout one character dies in the end and no one including the viewer even notices while more characterization was needed in the beginning half it wasnt too bad the second half was i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didnt know how to shoot the violent scenes so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian a silly ending doesnt help either thus unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin you should probably skip the fear 2 halloween night zanatos score 4 out of 10,0,-1,positive,

if this film had a budget of 20 million id just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original playstation 1 game and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 197583 and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same 20 million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again i hated it completely i regress i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar im betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films i want my money back,0,0,positive,

in cold blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the hollywood film industry capote coined the phrase nonfiction novel to describe the book on which this film is based and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script which he cowrote despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film richard brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story this is the first problem with the tv remake color changes the tone of the story in addition the confinement of shooting a film for tv makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused as a result we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film police interviews trial imprisonment and execution so claustrophobic on the small screen its just another version of law and order spinoffs hollywoods search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age usually thats a mistake and this is no exceptionall of the actors are competent the script is ok the directing doesnt get in the way its just that the movie doesnt work as well as the original precision instrument it doesnt hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward smith and hickock that the original film provokes at the end of the tv version we are left with the feeling ho hum who caressee the original first on as large a screen as you can then watch the tv version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967wouldnt hurt to also go on line and read a bit about capote and the original book it will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the moviei actually only gave this a 4 because i save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombsthe kind that enrage you about having been sucked into spending an,0,-1,neutral,

the leap years is a movie adapted from an enovella by singapore writer catherine lim which became the first singapore novelnovella to be sold over the internet the film had a tortuous postproduction schedule shot in early 2005 it was slated for release at the end of 2005 but only turn up eventually 3 years later on the 29th february 2008 a leap yearbefore i say anything i must first admit im no fan of the romance genre so i may be a little biased against this film i watched it merely because it was a singapore production and that its available for borrowing at my neighborhood library heres my two cents on the movielets just start by saying that other than qi yuwus ks and wong lilin everybody here of note seems to be a eurasian the love interest is a eurasian ananda everingham and wongs trio of buddies are all erhem eurasians does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with eurasians are more in than the common chinese or whatever asian race you are i dont know it sure seems that way also everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical anglified accent which doesnt exist anywhere certainly not in singapore its the kind of semiperfect english that authorities would like us speak but which doesnt exist anywhere outside say the mtv channel the effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted not helped by the lack of trueblue singaporeans in the castthe scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string oneliners after oneliners after twenty minutes the wit of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clichs i guess i didnt enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable there are other incredulities in the film i cant for one believe that ks played by qi yuwu would fall for one of wongs girlfriends and the scene where the bridegroom says go before i change my mind has been used in a hundred east asian korean chinese hong kong taiwanese etc tv serialsso 4 stars for this film the production value is fair and wong lilin tries her best but shes not helped by the script joan chen has a 15minute bitpart in the movie as the older wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot but hey her role is just cameoif you come across the leap years in the rental or library you may want to pop it in the dvd player for curiositys sake but otherwise for people who dont exactly enjoy the romance genre you can decide whether or not to give it a miss,0,-1,positive,

this cartoon is not rightlol i totally disagree with a lot of things it portrayed however it ended on a positive note but as for me and mine we will not be viewing this in our household mainly because we fight against stereotypes every day and this cartoon just confirms what most white people feel black people act likethe comment one of the little black girls made on the cartoon was that her boyfriend was so conscious he was white that really offended me thats not something we as black people take lightly conscious is a state of being that black people achieve when they realize their true ability,0,-1,neutral,

like a lot of series pilots dark angels opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet not that this is unusual in any way but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more in todays world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused with all guns blazingthe ninetyminute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together and both episodes have a problem with focus in the first half we are introduced to max and filled in on what drives her we also get a few interesting routines with max using her abilities to win bets interacting with a pi or sorting out coworkers domestic problems the problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes on television or otherwiseits when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus throughout the two halves max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time in the second half the repercussions catch up with him and max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess this sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series and it works but it doesnt quite click if you get my meaning its like most of the pieces are there but a couple that make a complete image have been left out perhaps they get filled in with later episodes but thats beside the point the fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twentyeight less minutesthe last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing original cindy in particular is an annoyance and i doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes while the acting isnt as bad as daytime soap it isnt of such quality that id commend it jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it leastthe good news is that the premise and the production values are all topnotch in fact this series was considered quite expensive to produce and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didnt last a whole season especially when there was ample time for both shows they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality tv the fact is that we need more shows like dark angel where imagination rather than overhype are used to draw the attentionin all i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten it never rises above the level of throwaway television and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time but the potential is there and thats often all that matters where pilots are concerned,1,0,positive,

i saw this film a while ago on a video cdi will 1st mention the good pointsthe movie at first at least tries to appear that it is not biased like not showing one character as black and the other as white both main characters are friends and coexist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport sport rifle shooting as comrades not as competitorsbut after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road the audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other that for some unknown reason bosnia is now on a path to conflict sure the script adds in tv footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in english but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war beganthe history the 1990 elections the people who caused the war are not mentioned the movie tries to place the blame with karadzic who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the bosnian parliaments 2nd largest partysdp according to the constitution of bosnia the sdp was to have the presidency in 1992 but there was a coup in january the bosnian islamic democratic action party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in march in which it declared itself the law in bosnia and announced secessionthe history of the idap begins with bosnian muslim alija izetbegovic a man suspiciously absent from stth he was a student of nazism in ww2 he even wrote his own mein kampf in which he stated it is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between the islamic religion and nonislamic social and political institutionsin 1990 he lost the idap elections to proyugoslavia moderate fikret abdic a bosnian muslim that worked with christian serbs during the civil war and who treated his supporters like brothers abdic was prevented from taking power by izetbegovic who lost the elections but seized the seat of powerthe events from above are missing from the movie but they are the factual events that lead to the warthere were problems with props too serb soldiers in the movie were wearing soviet ww2 helmets which they did not use also the one soldier was holding an m1944 ww2 rifle only used by ussr not yugoslaviathe director and script writers had a chance but they chose to rewrite history,0,-1,negative,

an awful b movie at best with video quality similar to dead alive i challenge anyone who is a aliens james cameron 1986 movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two alien movies to make this classic piece of garbagecast members such as r lee ermey and ray wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead jack scalia was really absolutely horrible i think they cast him for his massive cleft chin i was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set john tolesbey who must look at this movie and just wonder look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting moviesbut on this movie the script as i said earlier was a ripoff of aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine thriller it included such lines as i got a bad feeling about this and kill me as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the alien hop just before it pops out of his stomach there is also a ripoff of the classic get some via bill paxton we also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie aliens and the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid as opposed to having acid for blood there are many more major examples so if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics alien and aliens with sigourney weaver youll have a more enjoyable timethe plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasnt very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not the whole command structure between crew and capt was poorly done im not even sure if there are captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs in general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples like dive depth etcif you like horrible movies or are a big fan of alien and aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you as for me this one is going back on the shelfpermanently,0,0,positive,

woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic an american werewolf in london was indisputably a gem of a movie humorous demented with just a dash of romance and so very very british it made me want to stand up and sing god save the queen every time the movie ended then came this abomination you know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered and actually start cheering for the lycanthropes tell you the truth folks i only got about half way through this cgied travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyones time,0,-1,neutral,
the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend her aunt edna may olivera person too talented for this film didnt like wheelera sentiment i can easily relate to the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king at about the same time woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king so when wheeler arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friendswhich greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is a national pastimei am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywoodthe silent era through the 1940s i have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolseythe only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey i cant help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better for example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brothers film duck soup yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp at times woolsey talked a bit like groucho but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny in fact he just seemed to prattle pointlessly his only funny quality was that he looked goofysurely not enough reason to put him on film additionally wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheesea piece of cheese that sang very poorly a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as whos on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing in fact soon after they started their spiel they just ended the routineso prematurely that you are left frustrated i knew that whos on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twistonce again i have found yet another subpar film by this duo while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly such as silly billies and the rainmakerswhich i actually gave 6s to on imdb this one was a major endurance test to completesomething that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey where was all the humor,0,0,positive,

jesus christ what the hell happened here this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen how is it possible that they screwed up such a nice idea for a movie to tell you the truth i was so hyped for this i though it was like blair witch but with actual alien creatures chasing the camera guy goddamn it i have been reduced to fast forwarding this pile of sht and i never do that while seeing movies the high rating here on imdb makes me believe that actual aliens are giving 10s for this piece of crapinvasion is about well an invasion the movie starts by saying that everything youre about to see is real blahblahblah then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars as if i need to believe their bullsht to enjoy this movie next thing you know im seeing the most boring car driving ever filmed in a forest at night mind you is this a movie or a disney theme park ride the first 20 minutes is all boring dialog between cops while seeing grass and one straight road with a flashlight where the hell were the aliens they were sleeping of course then we learn that bad acting is not only reduced to high school plays as the cop behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was nightfishing and had stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite i wonder what happens to him out of nowhere we see the nightfishing guy walking like a zombie the cop is apparently too dumb to notice that something is wrong with this man apparently he was indeed dumb as the zombiealien guy injects in the cops ear some sort of alien parasite thus changing him into an alien then the copalien goes back into his car looks for a young couple that were having sex a while back in the forest gets to them changes the guy into an alien and then the girl runs to the cops car and escapes if this quick plot introduction didnt get it in your head that this movie was bad then the following 40 minutes will watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork the script while it may sound interesting on the back of the dvd box is badly directed and sadly we are left with another boring straight to dvd atrocitythe only thing that kept me awake were the constant flashing and loud sound effects lamentably if seeing the same forest trail for 63 minutes is not enough we must endure crappy flashing techniques to scare the viewer and constant wailing of a bad actress that gets old and annoying pretty quickif you feel you must rent this i say to you why there are better scifihorror films out there even the dreaded remake of the invasion of the body snatchers is more entertaining than this for the love of all things good dont bother with his crap my eyes bled and for the first time i wanted suicide a 110 avoid this like a disease,0,0,positive,
i watched this on an 8 hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mildthe actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fianc falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they dont get together but eventually she lets them do it sadly the actual film wasnt as good ok there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on i think the whole gaybutnotgay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasnt really very funnyin summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call,1,1,positive,

there arent too many times when i see a film and go huh what but this was one of them maybe after seeing zabriskie point i felt much the same way woody allen felt after seeing 2001 he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on michelangelo antonioni in one of his few tries at making films inside of the us after red desert he did blowup this film china and the passenger all filmed outside his native italy i could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium the results show that he doesnt lack the means to present images feelings tones colors sounds and a visual representation of this era a directors job is to see antonioni once stated whatever that means he doesnt disappoint for the admirer of his postfifties work i say postfifties since ive yet to see any of his films from before lavventurawhat he does lack is a point at least the kind of point that he could bring in blowup and the eclipse you get the feeling of what is around these characters what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness however in this case the characters and the actors dont bring much conviction or purpose antonioni coming from the school of hardknocks neorealistic filmmaking does do what he can with his mostly nonprofessional cast those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters but the two stars mark frechette and daria halprin seem as if antonionis underdirecting them perhaps that was the point the storys split into three acts thankfully not too confusing as mark escapes his existence around the boiling dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60s la area and daria is sent out from la to drive to phoenix for some business meeting they meet by chance as marks plane how does he know how to drive maybe a little background info there and darias car meet up and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene much of this act isnt terribly interesting the two leads are fair enough to look at but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity the ideas that come forth in part from a screenplay cowritten by sam shepard arent too revealing except for one brief instant where drugs vs reality is brought up then the film heads towards the third act as mark decides to do the right thing under disastrous circumstances and daria arrives at her boss place only to be in full disillusionment not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film although the film took its time telling its story i didnt have as much of a problem with that as i did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer i understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the selfconfidence of the antiestablishment but maybe antonioni isnt entirely fully aware of it himself in some scenes he as director and editor and the often astounding cinematography by alfio contini find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground not to say the technical side of zabriskie point isnt involving to a degree this may make some feel drowsy as antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say francis ford coppola is the deserts skies city and even the faces in closeups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame bringing us in the soundtrack is equally compelling with a master stroke including a sweet rolling stones song at one point and then a crushing surreal pink floyd song retitled from careful with that axe eugene one of their best predark side in the explosion sequence if only the performances werent so onesided i might find this to be on par with blowup or the eclipse its an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand and on the other a boring take on what was the hippieradical movement of the late 60s but hey what may be boring for an american such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the us such as say italy and it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing,1,-1,positive,
to me this review may contain spoilers but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilersi just watched this movie again and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie ever ever ever the real translation the beating of the butterflys wings is oddly not used as the translated title i suppose they thought most americans wouldnt know what chaos theory is except for those who saw or read jurassic park the movie is based on chaos theory and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events which all lead back to one event the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters about 20 in a way the ending seems inevitable despite this but if you think about it it is a perfect ending think to yourself what else needed to be said it is at the same time a very brave ending too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood,1,0,positive,

i dont understand your objections to this movie it is a taut thrilling extension of the character created in basic instinct the only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic is the fact that sharon stones character is still alive and not in jail at this late datespoiler alert as the movie progresses we are presented with three theories of what is going on 1 sharon stones character is killing all these people because shes crazy risk addicted 2 david thewlis crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame sharon stones character 3 david morrisseys analyst is killing these people for revenge what upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the real story although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop the only killing that occurs on screeni think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of 2001 a space odyssey who cares what is real the blonde really is crazy the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge whats important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story like real life everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie get over it,1,1,positive,

to be hones i used to like this show and watch it regularly but now thank god i dont understand why did i watch it sex and the city is one of the most pointless and insulting tv shows ive ever seen i really dont get the point of this show despite of trying people are saying that sex and the city is funny in what way by cursing all the time talking about vibrators and the size of the penis give me a breaki dont understand the plot we have four girls who are trying to find a perfect man by sleeping with every dork who comes around and this show is all about four spoiled chicks who are sleeping with every man in the city but in the end they admit the best pleasure comes out of the penis vibrators and yeah the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every relationship if you can have a good sex youre a good husband or wife it doesnt matter if you want to be loyal and having a good heart the size does matterthe biggest problem is also bad acting the four main actresses sarah jessica parker kim cattral cynthia nixon and kristin davis are so bad and unconvincing that it makes me sick just watching this show parker is just screaming and complaining all the time cattral is showing her old boobs and saying the f word all the time davis delivers her smile and nothing else and nixon acts like she is bored all the time and yes men are sex hungry pigs in this show but judging by this show women are not much better this show is insulting for men and women the women are shown so primitive and emotionless like they dont have any heart just hunger for sex its insulting for everyonesex and the city is one of the worst tv shows and im glad that the show ended because it delivers bad acting and pointless stories the whole world is not all about sex and vibrators,0,0,positive,
it seems like this is the only film that john saxon ever directed and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera this movie is a dog from start to finish and its dull and wooden with nothing much going for it a viet nam war hero takes a job working for a mob boss gets a bit too friendly with the wife and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself the war hero framed and sent to prison death row specifically now this particular prison has been experimenting on inmates and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine a zombie of course everything goes wrong and then theres all these infected people trapped in the prison some of whom are turning into zombies and the rest who suddenly just dont want to be there anymore this just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say for itself and i stopped it before the end which seemed like it was coming a few times but no it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path if one watched to the end they may well become a zombie themselves so dont risk it 2 out of 10,0,-1,neutral,

i cannot stay indifferent to lars van triers films i consider breaking the waves nothing less than a masterpiece i loved dancer in the night i admired the idea in dogville but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical less cinema europa which i see only now was a famous film at its time succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie but did not survive well the time in my opinion it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my tastethe story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today more such was novel and courageous two decades ago yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the taskthe film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock especially his early films set in the prewar europe with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the rebirth of germany after war of its might of its obsession with order and regulation of punctuality and civility the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys the principal character a young american of german origin coming to postwar europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of selfdestruction with love doubtfully mixed with treasonit is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case the actions of the characters especially of leopold kessler played by jeanmarc barr seem confused and lack credibility the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcocklike but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late 30s the usage of color over the blackandwhite film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means but he is too demonstrative he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is he really is great as he will show in some of his later films but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone,0,-1,positive,

as a scifi and casual angelina jolie fan i thought this obviously lowbudget movie might be worth a look maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults plus it might be interesting to watch angelina as she was embarking on her starbound careeroh how wrong i was one thing i learned at 18 angelina jolie couldnt act so to make her comfortable the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldnt act seeing this jack palance who can actually act decided to overact watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes outto the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script insipid dialog bottomofthebarrel cinematography in fact add bottomofthebarrel everythingthe story features angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin she escapes the corporate hq with the help of her combat instructor the corporation sends bounty hunters after them stupid stuff happens the end i would tell you more but i didnt want to waste my life watching this drecki implore you this is not worth watching its not even worth thinking about watching save yourself the pain and move on,0,0,negative,
first of all i dont understand why some people find this movie so antiamerican sure there are moments when the us are accused directly like at the segments of youssef chahine ken loach and to a certain extent mira nair but come on they arent naive accusations instead they are based on real and documented facts and all the documents that the cia released about chile confirms this for examplebut returning to the film itself what i enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it we find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of september 11 and react differently to this with dignity or frustration we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happinessall these visions and others as powerful as these or even more make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of september 11th thus what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks and this may make some people infuriated but this is the world where we live and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies regardless of what presidents or priests may say usfinally i think its a shame that there isnt even a release date for this movie in the united states of america its a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened and this movie could give some clues to them this film puts very clearly differently of what some people of this forum think that everything we do today will determine our future and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today,1,-1,positive,
i saw this film on the history channel today in 2006 first of all i realize that this is not a documentary that it is a drama but one might hope that at least the critical facts that the story turns on might be based on actual events reagan was shot and the other characters were real people the movie got that right from there on reliance on facts rapidly decays i had never heard of this movie before seeing it having been a tv reporter at the time of these events i was stunned that i had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of secretary haig as portrayed by richard dreyfuss the whole nation had heard the i am in control etc but dreufuss haig is bullying a cowered cabinet and totally out of control personally having watched the film i began researching the subject on the internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and transcripts of most of the situation room conversations that this film pretends to reenact incredibly many the the principal facts of the film meant to show a white house secret service etc in total chaos and the nations leadership behaving irrationally and driving the world near the brink of nuclear war are demonstrably incorrect they didnt happen there is internal conflict to be sure haig makes missteps his press room performance is historically regrettable and he is difficult but there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film there are too many gross errors to list but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish enlighten inform entertain i believe they failed on all three fronts it is difficult to ascribe motives to others but one must seriously question what was behind such shameless invention and as for my beloved history channels reel to real followon documentary there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film namely the events within the administration on the day of the shooting so the viewer was left to research those without much if any help from the network,0,-1,positive,

when i die someone will bury me and if they dont whats the difference who gives a damn huh thus the philosophy of life or lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spin off of sergio leones dollars trilogy in the opening scene three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and with menacing glares they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes the observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from leones for a few dollars more there is one guy in eastwoods poncho one in lee van cleefs black suit and one seeming to act like gian marie volontes indio but this movie is not about these guys no sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the strangerno this is an altogether different storyin an obvious copying of leones the good the bad and the ugly three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican bandit the stranger george hilton is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest he is after the reward for the bandit monetero gilbert roland but when moneteros gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins the stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of workto round off the trio there is edd byrnes corrupt bank executive clayton he too wants the money for himself but after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does and any gun can playwith plenty of gunfights fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good the bad and the ugly but with a twistthis movie is not as good as leones films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh this movie is fun 60s nihilism spaghetti western style there are no rules no enduring loyalties and no right or wrong just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it and though the movie is not classic the ending surely is hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a pieceif you like spaghetti westerns check this one out it is fast furious and worth the look my name is evren buyruk from crestline california,1,0,negative,

i find it heartwarming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a lowbudget exploitation horror film like this perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers messiah of evil has potential but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it cant muster the filmmaking prowess to pull it offthe premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back it doesnt take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70s exploitation as an example of artful mystery horrorthe surreal nonsequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the blood moon a scruffy and halfmad alcoholic played by the great elisha cook jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley eaten by dogs a little later the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her fathers paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded murderous squirreleating albinopart of the movies charm is precisely this brand of bargainbasement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator with messiah of evil the boundaries between the intentional the unintentional and the didnt really expect it to come out this way but its good enough wrap scene blur hopelesslytake for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drugaddled feverish streamofconsciousness way one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father and the other narrated by her fathers voice as she reads his diary while were still talking about a living dead picture messiah of evil is different and only loosely one at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse bestowed upon the town by a mysterious dark stranger who came from the woods one day in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of massconsumption criticism in a flesheating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years you can hear the mst3k line already man is dead only his capitalist food tins remain and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theateri generally think that the surreal works in careful well measured doses how is the absurd to work if its not hidden within the perfectly normal hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience amused and satisfied with his own hijinks the general filmmaking level is also pretty low after the halfway mark the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either add to that the choppy editing average acting and hyucks general inability to capture true atmosphere the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused and id file messiah under missed opportunity but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate even though its not particularly gory trashy or sleazy,0,-1,positive,

hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straightforward drama without much to recommend it hitchcocks talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting pointofview shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcocks early work and his development as a visual storyteller,1,-1,positive,

a most recommendable masterpiece not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos not to mention the acting of giants mastroianni and moreau and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis gregory karrs performance may seem overshadowed by his tough partners at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl khrysikou and the man mastroianni albeit hinted beforehand hence the spoilerget your expectations straight its an art movie in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention not for spending free time but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert due to the overall photographic style large screen viewing is recommendeddialogues are used sparingly but the film includes in addition to the standard greek and english speaking fragments spoken in albanian kurdish and turkish which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages,1,1,positive,
the movie is just as fun as staring at the sunsheriff pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of nicholas cage sucking up all that so called blood which in reality seemed like fruit punchmost of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a moviethe rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time the ending was awful the outlines were cheesy and the scenes were terrible what else more should i say to you viewers out there my advice would be to get your rabies shot if youve already watched the movie this movie may give you the foam in the mouth if you didnt get your uptodate shots,0,0,positive,
i thought maybe maybe this could be good an early appearance by the reanimator jeffery combs many homages to old horror movies the troma label on the front this movie could be a gem i thought wrongfrightmare is a boring overplayed half assed homage to the fright films of yore the story is an old one young people breaking into a house getting drunk making love and tampering with things that shouldnt be tampered with the oft recycled slasher film formula is used here this time with a thought to be dead actor named conrad radzoff doing the killing in fact the performance by the radzoffs actor ferdy mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film he does the snooty dracula style character very well but as for the kids its not so good with combs only having a minimal partthe film lacks entertainment value and only features one cool character and one or two scenes that can hold your attention i do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch and this is the only movie left at blockbuster,0,0,positive,

i love this movie purple rain came out the year i was born and it has had my heart since i can remember prince is so tight in this movie i went to a special showing of purple rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued it is really one of the greatest movies of all time the music is untouchable the movie is about the kid played by prince his family is dysfunctional his band is the hottest act in town and he has his eyes on the apollonia an aspiring singer there is no question why purple is my favorite color i can thank the kid for that so if you have not seen this then you are need to asap this is a classic 4ever,1,1,positive,
i originally came across linda fefermans seven minutes in heaven when i was 14 and worked at a video store and i loved it i recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure the movie stars jennifer connelly almost twenty years before she would go on to win an oscar for beautiful mind as natalie becker byron thames plays her best friend in the world jeff moran the film is definitely a milder cuter and softer version of the pretty in pinks and some kind of wonderfuls of the 1980s which is exactly why it is so good its honest not forced like those films and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kidswhen natalies dad leave home on a business trip jeff convinces her that he should move in because his home life sucks with support from natalies friend polly played exquisitely by maddie corman she lets him but this movie isnt about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can get away with the three leads are so natural and the script surprisingly so honest that what comes through best in their performances is heart breaking these characters really do care about each other its a great film to show to kids who are reaching preteen adolescence,1,1,positive,

finally i thought someone is going to do justice to hg wellss classic not another version set in the wrong locale or era but one based firmly on the book well it definitely follows the book pretty closely and that is the only plus to this messthis is 180 mins yes 3 hours long the book is only around 150 pages if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say if you can do any better i would say yes i could and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my lifei paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa do not make the same mistake as me,0,-1,neutral,

perhaps the director was trying for another pirate good garland and kelly musical but this lame musical epoch falls flat sinatra and kathryn graysons voices do not blend well and their chemistry together lacks spark the premise of sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late bandito father is okay but he seems awkward in the role whats amazing and wonderful here is how sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again when grayson sings the same songs its hard to believe shes not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting she has her big moment with love is where you find it which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities the photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets costars mildred natwick and j carroll nash put lots of energy into making the impossible work aside from sinatras singing there is a strange menageatois dance with ricardo montalban cyd charisse and ann miller its fascinating and weird montalban and charisse were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity,0,1,positive,

bo dereks debut film remained unseen for eight years and thats how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a director hes virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema not that this is especially explicit considering that bo atypically sporting dark hair was only 16 when the film was made john also wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bos family they grew up as brother and sister but now in their teens the couple discover theyre attracted to one another but as i said dont expect any sexual fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and keeps expecting a cruiseliner to appear into view which of course it does at the finale dereks is even nuttier she craves possession of a large antique bathtub for the record the couple are married by the end of the filmalso involved in the nonevents are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo and who naturally incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten occasionally for no very good reason were even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an openair movie house to which the whole town assembles among the titles shown is the public enemy 1931 at the end of the day while bos naivete throughout is undeniably charming its not enough to offset the films overwhelming dullness and amateurishness,0,0,negative,

i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema so after watching the trailer for water lilies i expected to like this film because i thought id stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love sort of a female version of beautiful thing the main characters are young french women 15 years old marie is slender reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way floriane is outgoing athletic and beautiful and anne is loyal pudgy and behaviorally immature the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie if not at the surface then just below it water lilies however is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens it is about sexual frustration suffering ennui teens working at crosspurposes and in at least two instances joyless mechanical sex it also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers mar their own creations when they become too manipulativein the extra features on the lord of the flies dvd director peter brook says french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism part of the downfall of this film is filmmaker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicismwhere is the joy i asked myself while watching this film yes first love can be painful and frustrating but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh lifeaffirming way these positive aspects are missing from this movie there is no balanceorganically this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film first what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema as evidenced by films like the slingshot the rascals the devil probably the little thief murmur of the heart friends beau pere and europa europa but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion see audience i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity wouldve been an honest way to gothere is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie it is filmmaker sciamma cynically manipulating her audienceperhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie shes about to request something that is not normal marie understandably asks who cares about being normal then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie because florianes request is a phony derivative and substitute question not the authentic heartfelt question the movie maries character and the viewers whove invested their time deserve here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewers nerves 1 since when do the french of all people take baths wearing bathing suits and with a turtle to boot 2 what teen of any nationality would chomp down on an apple core thats been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloveds mouththe three main actresses are promising and if they find better vehicles for their talents may become excellent actors louise blachere anne is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles adele haenel floriane could become a leading lady or a bombshell or both pauline acquart marie possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable in the future she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaimall in all water lilies was very disappointing will an honest filmmaker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love no not necessarily for the sake of this middleaged guy but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with and yes to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema,0,-1,positive,
a lot is dated in this episode just like most twilight zone episodes such as the womans incredibly sexist military uniform and some things are so unbelievable like the easy availability of clean water still consider the year this was made and the time and you quickly understand why this episode is so special as you watch it has a nice sense of hope something missing from a lot of twilight zones as well as an interesting female character despite the fact that she rarely speaks something else rare on the twilight zone two is a great example of how the twilight zone in just over 20 minutes could pack more emotion and drama than most two hours movies today and its great to see two people who became american icons so early in their careers,1,1,positive,

this film is one giant pant load paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process the worst though is woody harrelson whom i ordinarily like when hes properly cast he plays the walker a homosexual man in dc who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite he couldnt have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick his southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has it is monotonous but his is not the worst accent in the movie his boyfriend played by moritz bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him he is incapable of rolling his rs in spite of the fact that in real life he is german and speaks several languages one of them being italian thats kind of a good reason to cast someone else dont ya think from the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses lily tomlin lauren bacall and kristin scott thomas only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact in fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws if you like these three actresses watch them in something else this movie is not worth your time,0,0,positive,

this has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the scifi channel here is how the movie starts women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is a ok as long as it only targets soldiers in case your wondering men however the virus back fires big shockand all the men on earth slowly die then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man now we are taken around 60 to 70 years from now two female scientists are working on cloning a female baby and one of them says hey why dont we bring men back the other one says no the world is not ready for that but promptly ignores her and thus a man walks the eath againfirst off this movie assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood thirsty monsters secondly the writer forgot to mention that present day soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers so there is no real reason to have a virus like that this is the biggest waist of time you can find this movie managed to insult my intellect not only by the bad story but with the lifetime style acting avoid this movie at all costsi give this a 1 out of 10 but only because i could go no lower,0,0,negative,

cat in the brain is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview describing director lucio fulcis most notorious years of filmmaking the movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life fulci goes further than that he casts himself as the star the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore cat in the brain is not about presenting a clear story and following it instead it pokes fun at some of the clichs that have been surrounding the horror genre for yearslucio fulci plays himself as a horror director struggling to keep his humanity intact years of violent film making have finally began to reach him it starts slowly steaks and meat in general begin to disgust him his colleagues assure fulci that all he needs is some rest but that doesnt help and soon the grotesque ideas for his movies begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts in an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously maddening mental state lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist unfortunately that does more wrong than good and fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the murders from fulcis films in real lifethe film retains all the trademarks of italian splatter cinema good or bad they are all here so any comments about the acting or the technical aspects and budget constrains are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film it is a visual experience no doubts about it fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily surpassing pretty much everything hes made amputated by chainsaw limbs cannibalism child murder decapitation these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in cat in the brain some of them are obviously recycled from a few the directors less profile movies but they dont stand out of the context and actually feel quite at home here as i noted before the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece the way some of the violence is presented does help establish that idea such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality in the film as they are revealed to be actually scenes inside a movie that fulcis character is directing this sort of film in film presentation lessens somewhat the impact of the gore but in no way does it make it an easy to watch film oh no this is far beyond and above the levels of gore found in mainstream horror and gorehounds will in no doubt be satisfied with that factlucio fulci was a very polarized figure people either hate his work or love it cat in the brain wont convince any of fulcis detractors in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography one that fans should really check out,1,0,positive,
the ali g show was really something amazing he was so stupid wannabe rapper but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending sasha cohen is actually very intelligent guy who pretends to be stupid so he could get really honest answers from people and it is very funny so i didnt expect movie to be good cause it was all acted no real people or interviews so the basic point of all show was lost but i was wrong i laughed all the time it was one of the funniest films i ever saw sure it was stupid but who cares if you cant actually brake in to safe with a car battery like someone said it wasnt supposed to be a realistic documentary and it isnt like the show it goes in totally different way but that doesnt mean it is bad when i finished watching i was totally impressed but now when some time passed i realized that it was not that special anyway but it still deserves a nine well at least for what it is supposed to be,1,-1,positive,

that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husbands first wife who died under mysterious circumstances that sounds well and good but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin well trust me no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls peacocks weird gardeners and doors being knocked on and the music is the worst it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate yes in the end this is a slow paced which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour boring little tale that is easily figured out by the average person apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person,0,0,positive,
though this film doesnt stand out particularly from the movie crowd its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up there maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch and the cinematic are a little slipshod the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it the music contributes a lot to the mood of the moviethe acting is none the less impressive especially the dog he he with john travolta taking the lead of the funtroublesomeloving michael other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the filmso after a long day at work stick michael on in the evening with some icecream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right,1,1,positive,
carole lombard and james stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple the scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors each with a different goal some are capracute some screwball some melodramatic and some surprisingly noir theres even an extended adventure sequence when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard its hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone and the storyline not exactly believable only worth watching for film students or fans of the actorssome smaller parts such as judge doolittle and the intrepid pilot are also very well played,0,-1,neutral,

townies is the laziest movie i have ever seen and i saw the blair witch movies parts one and two it seems confused in what it wants to be its not funny enough for comedy its not tragic enough for drama its not bloody enough for horror and its not good enough for watching it has scenes of a man doing slapstickbloody karate so i think oh this movie will be in the vein of toxic avenger and street trash then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl a retarded mentally handicap woman and a trusting mother then it slaps itself into the only good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks the part im speaking of is a lonely townie who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse that was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling the rest was a waist of my life then just to show how cruel wayne is there is a kind of documentary at the end of the film of wayne the director making fun of toby the star in public it made me sick even though killer nerd and bride of killer nerd two other movies by wayne arent the best they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits i even like killer nerd a bit it had some great lines i still use to this dayif you like underground films if you like overground films and if you like to watch your feet just resting were they are you will not like townies12 out of,0,1,positive,
this was my first and probably the last angelopoulos movie i was eager to get into it as it featured mastroianni one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo of whom ive heard a lot the opening was promising a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the albaniangreek border ok but that was all nothing left the movie had big holes and i dont know which to mention first the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman during a long walk its like a 15 minutes monologue killing the action and viewers patience nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes apart this old lady telling a story all that is presumed to be shown through action was simply told to the camera by the old lady in a moment the equippe of tv was heading to the bar they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins probably shot in different days continuity leaked a lot of problems with the storytelling it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style making the viewer asking questions that never got answers poor mastroianni given a role which lacked integrity or charm on the other hand as many greeks or albanians or balcan people would agree with the movies showed lot of historic ethnic or politically incorrectness just for the sake of making a movie about humanity as a red in another review a lot more to say but no time to lose on a poor movie which was not movie at all but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money,0,0,negative,

remember greg the bunny it was this show that started on the independent film channel but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox my cousin and i thought it was pretty funny beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on tvpg material puppets who kill occurs in a similar universe where puppets live in the same world as people and like us take on jobs and lives of their own lets just say if you couldnt handle that then dont bother watching pwk as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of societys good graces through drug abuse hedonism and violent felonies only to end up in a halfway house theres plenty of violence sex and bad language so it would never make its way to us network tv as if sociopathic puppets werent enough the fact that this takes place in canada makes it even more disturbing btw the government pays for this and i think any american television viewer would demand more demented cable tv fodder like this i dont know where you can get it in the us beyond extra satellite tv but id advise you give it a try really funny stuff it airs on the comedy network in canada,1,0,negative,

louise brooks gives a wonderful performance in this wellmade french melodrama she plays a typist named lucienne who despite being in love with a man named andre dreams of rising above her position in life she sees opportunity in a beauty contest for miss europe but andre is furious when he discovers that shes entered then demands that she withdraw she tries to take back her entry only to discover that shes already been chosen as miss france and will now go on to the main pageantthis is a story of love loss and decision played out to its passionate end the movie is very energetically filmed by director augusto genina and cinema tographers rudolf mate and louis nee the filming style is more like modern movies than the hollywood flicks of the 30s and shows the different style employed by europeans there are many fast cuts and traveling shots mostly done with great skill and verve the high energy of the movies first third dwindles a bit in the middle but picks up again in the last 15 minutesthe performances were very good by all the principals but that of louise brooks is especially memorable louise leans heavily on her silent screen skills even though this is a talkie but because her silent style had a surprisingly contemporary understated feel she makes the transition to talkies very well the long early scene at the fair was especially poignant as louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation of being trapped in a life she no longer wants i doubt its ever been done betterthe film builds to a superb finale artfully shot powerful and stylish this is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film and the tragic storyline only underscores the greater tragedy that this is the final starring role for louise brooks she wasnt just a great beauty who looked fantastic in a swimsuit she really was a major acting talent who basically threw it all away we are all the poorer for thatthis movie is less well known than her german films with gw pabst but i think its a better one i think this crew is just better at storytelling than pabst and while prix de beaute may lack the deep moral complexity of the pabst films its much easier to follow and is overall a more streamlined focused piece of work and it doesnt hurt that louises singing parts are done by edith piaf eitherbottom line this is a classic louise brooks film well worth looking for,1,1,positive,

had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called half empty i usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest sequel or prequel that hollywood throws at us this was different and surprisingly so much more entertaining than anything hollywood spends millions advertising when my husband and i go the movies we go to be entertained and half empty did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it it is a funny human and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly entertains in its simplicity i especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom it is almost like an operetta that particular scene reminded me of a scene in phantom of the opera when 4 of the performers did not just ie they sang against one another in a friendly retort i am not a film maven but this film was more enjoyable than any other major studio film i have seen lately it is silly funny entertaining and amusing completely enjoyable which is what i expect from movies but rarely do they deliver like half empty,1,-1,positive,

a surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as batmantas and its ilk i enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again great voice acting from tim curry richard moll tony jay and maurice lamarche in various roles the only qualm i had was rob paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character but that wasnt a big deal as the stories were great and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending some people say it was a copout but i found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging hopefully one day they put this series out on dvd unfortunately it came out at a time when dvds werent yet prevalent and the cartoon probably only served to sell a particular type of toy which i never found appealing despite the entertaining cartoon,1,1,positive,

if you have trouble suspending disbelief then this isnt for you consider a woman already in late middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and raises it as her own think about it she makes no attempt to locate the mother who may well be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment and seemingly no one from the italian equivalent of social services makes any attempt to put the baby into care no social services now i know its a fantasy before you know it young toto is ten or so and his adoptive mother dies leaving him to the orphanage from which he emerges a happy man who loves everybody in nothing flat he has not only given his suitcase to the man who stole it from him but organised the local homeless into bona fide shantytown residents and for an encore he leads them in a fight against capitalism in the shape of the businessman who buys the land on which the shantytown stands when oil is discovered there this wants some swallowing without the subsequent miracles beginning with totos dead mother the old lady who raised him rather than his biological one appearing to him and handing him a dove which doubles as a magic wand allowing him to grant modest wishes and a finale in which the hobos fly away to a better place located presumably somewhere over the rainbowon the other hand the film is up to here with charm and is easy to surrender to on balance a small masterpiece,1,-1,positive,
fires on the plain directed by kon ichikawa and written by shohei ooka and natto wada is a world war two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers but the japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the philippines the main characters name is tamura played by eiji funakoshi and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick all he has on him is a hand grenade his gun and some potatoes like this he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease but since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed he begins a long walk throughout the whole movie tamura remains a bit cowardish but very civil when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade a scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is when tamura comes into a phillipino village which is completely deserted there he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church this makes tamura think and even more scared than he already is that shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly after he turns away from the corpses two phillipinos a couple or brother and sister very close relationship return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back the main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first although he walked up to them with his gun but shoots the woman once she starts screaming her brotherboyfriendhusband then runs away in fear and after a moment tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing filipino he does not hit him after tamura picks up the bag of salt something very precious he drops his gun into a river this gesture is very important in order to understand kon ichikawasshohei ookas profiling of tamura and the war comparing this movie to other world war 2 movies it is not typical at all of course all movies have suffering heroes but their heroes are more heroic than tamura he expresses everything that is human he is getting manipulated he is weak he gets scared he has hope this is typical for japanese world war two movies and for japanese society since world war two is not a discussed theme in japanese society japanese are likely to put japanese in the second world war in the role of the victim this victimisation is also very visual in this movie one of the examples is tamura another one the piled up bodies of japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is when the japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike in my personal conclusion i have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual it also has no nationalistic propaganda which couldve been easily built in once you have watched the movie fully you will be able to see the horrors of the second world war to its total extent,1,-1,neutral,

this is how i interpreted the movie first things first there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy taylor torturing or nailing bens hands to the wall however the same cannot be told of the gals in the end too u see taylor disappear as he walks looks like the message there was there was no taylor and the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ben also there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ben it was taylor all the time but in real taylor was ben if they were two different people then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times but of course before that u do see both of them together and that cud just be bens imagination at work also when ben was out of jail the text on screen clearly says that bens story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained read mine cars etceven after liz hunter leaves kristy and comes back to find ben she doesnt find him why because ben taylor was out looking for the gals instead kristy has all the time in the world to check out taylors ben web cam photos etcsomehow everything sums up to just one fact that kristy and liz both of them knew that taylor was ben so my conclusion is that ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination otherwise if there really was a taylor then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben,1,0,negative,

this adaptation like 1949s the heiress is based on the henry james novel the heiress starring olivia de havilland remains as a wellrespected piece of work though less true to james original story than this new remake which retains james original title it is the story of a awkward yet loving daughter leigh devoted to her father finney after her mother dies during childbirth the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever and considers her as well as all women simpleminded when a young man chaplin of good family and little fortune comes courting the father is naturally suspicious but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him leigh is a controversial actress most either love her or hate her and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style like shes acting through gritted teeth shes not bad in this and she handles her role relatively deftly its just an awkward role for any actress making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses while the character garners a lot of sympathy shes not particularly likable the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin previously seen in the truth about cats and dogs plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune or is really in love with her maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the wellmeaning aunt finney is marvelous of course as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune this is only one instance where washington square differs from the heiress another instance is the ability to stick with it it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet offering too little story in too long of a movie,0,0,positive,

ingrid bergman is a temporarily impoverished polish countess in 1900s paris who finds herself pursued by frances most popular general and a glamorous count and thats on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history there are backroom political machinations by the generals handlers a downed balloonist and ecstatic bastille day throngs but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairsdownstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats yes its rules of the game redux before its all over even gaston modot the jealous gamekeeper in rules puts in an appearance as a gypsy capo no less things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end resulting in some confusion for this nonfrench speaker but what the heck elena and her men is another deeply humane renoir masterpiece,1,-1,neutral,

okay let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone whos read the other comments that being said my gd this movie reeked i mean wow i didnt know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than any roger corman movie corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script the only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said hey zombies are popular video games are popular what game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it resident evil no someone else got there first silent hill no too silent people will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly hey didnt sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies theyre out of the platform biz we could get that for penniesbasically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the gamethe first and major problem is that the original game was horrid i meanbadmoviemerchandisingmadeintoaworsegameintwoweeksandthenshippe doutandboughtbymoronsandtheirparentsforchristmas horrid the graphics were boring the monsters were boring the levels were boring the interface was boring the case was boring in other words this was a boring game and that was the arcade version the home version was even worse with the home version you didnt even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game but i digressthe second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes huh didnt the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on not to mention that every fight was shot from the perspective of a video game which may explain the tedious use of matrixstyle effects the problem with this is that the game was a firstperson shooter the player proceeds from the pov of the character maybe thats why they put in the game graphics to let you know that they were alluding to the game right whateveranyway the only thing that made this entire experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and didnt get me kicked outto sum up dont go see this movie dont even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week run just run,0,0,positive,
yet another recent comedy that shows that hollywood cant even do the basics when it comes to filmmaking that it used to do in its sleep for decades if the writerdirector had any brains they would have based the film around stamps character of tyrant boss jack taylor when hes in the film early on its nothing special but it is mildly promising and occasionally amusing once he departs for the majority of the film and kutcher has his hilarious adventures housesitting with guest after boring guest dropping in the film totally disintegratesas a result what should have been a passable timewaster turns into an inept stinker,0,0,negative,

this is an odd film for me as after i reviewed a nice film from a new film maker far out by phil mucci another writerdirector ryan jafri contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film the cure i dont normally review films this way but what the hecki love shorts and couldnt wait to see anotherinterestingly while it turned out i did like the cure i was not thrilled by it and let jafri know to his credit he encouraged me to review it anywaygiving it my honest appraisalthe film has tremendous style and as far as jafris direction goes its exceptionalespecially for such an inexperienced film maker its his first film the combination of exceptional choices of color pacing and music that wellsuited the film created a great sense of atmosphere you really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making however the thing i didnt love was some of the writing while the basic idea was great the ending was just too easy to foresee i really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist however considering that this film is from someone who shouldnt be able to make such a professional film given his experience it bodes well for his future good job,1,1,positive,

speck was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck there is however not much killing to be found in this movie and none of it is explicitly shown the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub yet even this is merely implied and not shown save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr specks leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voiceover which should be a testament to the mindnumbingly boring nature of this movie every aspect of this movie is horrible unless you have a fondness for boredom dont bother this movie only clocks in at 72 minutes but it feels like an eternity,0,0,negative,

its somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on imdb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career and yes youve guessed it that film is parasomnia ive often suspected suspiciously good reviews on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing but it seems fairly transparent in this casethats not to say parasomnia is terrible but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to beon the plus side it has a great baddie in patrick kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil i could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with hannibal lecter there are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better the actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great tooalthough i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story its the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly then the story is losing you and thats what kept happening to me with this film other reviewers have mentioned this here and i dont want to get into spoiler territory but i will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of lifeall in all there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special,0,0,positive,

im a petty officer 1st class e6 and have been in the uscg for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard there were only a few scenes that were far fetched the most farfetched was when po fischer kutcher went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessels captain out of the engine room that would never happen swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances second the command center supposedly in kodiak it looked more like a nasa command center we dont have any gear that hitech third the captain of the airstation would not be running the search rescue cases with like 10 people on watch in reality it would be an e6 or e7 as the sar controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist sar controller a radio watchstander otherwise the movie was dead on i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search rescue instead of just aviation based rates some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days,1,-1,neutral,
i love sharks and mutants and explosions theoretically with those parameters in mind hammerhead shark frenzy should have been the best movie everit is notthe monster looks like a villain from power rangers and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement this might be okay if the makers werent quite as proud of its design as they seem to be that is to say for a guy in a big rubber suit in an actionscifihorror flick that could benefit from some mystery the shark gets a lot of screen time granted it is usually shaky and erratic i guess youre supposed to assume that its so scary that even the camera guy freaks outthe camera goes to a person about to get eaten the camera goes to the shark the camera goes back to the person about to get eaten only now they are screaming and armless and so onthe costuming is bad the acting is poor and the special effects are subpar but the writing is by far the worst things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten or so something can explode because let me tell you the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions more better mindset characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion they shoot helicopters there is a massive explosion barrels rocks trees whatever they all explode so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the endspeaking of which i dont care how crazy a person is i find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant halfperson halfshark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea that is unless that person is the mad scientist in this moviethe bad thing is the movie is so random and at times boring that even its badness is not really enough to hold a persons prolonged interest it might be a good one to mst3k with your friends but past that if you happen to catch this bad boy on do yourself a favor and change the channel,0,0,positive,
i first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct trio channel a few years ago and recently watched it againsans commercialson sundance i was impressed the first time and found it even more engaging on second viewing yes some of the segments are far from perfectamos gitais hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumbbut taken collectively 11 09 01 is a total success best of show shohei imamuras amazing final segment which contemporary critics such as the thickwitted mick lasalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on the terrorists but now stands revealed as a masterful antiwar polemic samira makhmalbafs opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 911 with a prescient concern for the children of afghanistan and idrissa ouedraogos amusing childrens crusade for osama bin ladena hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the real osama youssef chahines segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that bin laden and alqaeda are basically creations of american foreign policy and the cia and though sean penns character study seems out of place its still an effectively bittersweet piece of filmmaking all in all essential viewing and a darn sight better than oliver stones reactionary world trade center,1,1,positive,
changi has a delightfully fresh script acted superbly by both young and old actors alike john doyle has done an excellent job bringing humour to a tragic true story keeping a sometimes sad story fun and engrossing particularly to those of us not familiar with the events of south east asia during ww2john doyles parallel story line successfully bridges the gap between past and present allowing the audience insight into the longterm effect war had on the prisoners and their familys lives as well as providing the basis for an excellent narrative which nicely rounds out the tales both individual and collective doyle deserves praise for this effort we have in the past been delighted by his abundant and quickwitted humour as evidenced in his long running collaboration with greg pickhaver as roy hgas the series is approaching half way we are looking forward to how the story develops with anticipation,1,1,positive,

while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer i was in for a deep surprise with this film while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too cartoonish the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience instead of the feelgoodhappystory this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing most kids wont understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults i was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts the musical score was once again solid proving hans zimmer is the goto guy when it comes to animated scores and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams music,1,-1,positive,
i think this still is the best routine there are some others like rocks bring the pain and allens men are pigs that are hilarious damon waynes last stand is also funny in a tearful way but this routine has no errors all the jokes are funny and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect just long enough to last 20 years i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted im a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool not putting in a category with ellen and newhart but something you can watch if youre bloated thanks eddie god bless,1,-1,positive,

not a bad movie but could have been done without the full frontal nudity of a 10 year old boy in one of the opening scenes this movie has excellent dialog which is certainly common among foreign films foreign actors still know how to act as opposed to american actors who let the cgi stunts and special effects do all the work for them this film is just good old fashion acting gerarde depardieux did an excellent job as always the costumes and scenery are accurate with the time my only complaint is that they should have dubbed the english words over the french instead of using subtitles this could just be because i hate reading subtitles,1,-1,positive,
this engaging which it shouldnt be lowgrade spanish exploitation quite tame i might add looks good but huh let me phrase that again huh actually the word huh would be going through your mind quite a lot nothing makes sense nor does it try too i just dont know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle but theres no denying how laconically uneventful strange and wordy it feelsunrelated sequences tied like that nasty opening involving a little girl dead cat and fire in to a sparse story involving photographer mario played by a chestpuffing john caffari whos mustache is a dead ringer for nintendos iconic mario whats the odds that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady a gorgeously fixating patty shepard who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witcheslook past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease raul artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages but for most part seems sporadically nonexistent and unfocused just like his writing ramon semperes striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away however there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on fernando garcia morcillos hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created the leads are capable but theres also a sturdy bunch the pick being vctor israel of secondary performancesslow with little in the way of interest but this dreamy setup that seems to go on and on manages to keep you watching until its closing,0,-1,neutral,

one of the classic low budget 70s movies this film was found in a bargain video shop in london for only 50p interestingly the package lists the star of the film as charles bone who sounds like a porn star but once the credits role its obvious that the picture is aligned to far the right of the tv screen so that all the cast members have the last letter missing from their namesfrom the moment the narrator lamely introduces us to the situation that the desperate tenants of a grimy new york city apartment block you know youre in for a rollercoaster ride of fromage the direction is from the ed wood onetake school if one or two extras were looking at the camera crew then what the hellthe films finishes with a plot twist that puts the usual suspects to shame buy it now,1,-1,neutral,

love hurts that i think is the main message mike binders newest film reign over me brings across whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love hurts the great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they cant free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay characterbased and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 911 effected us all ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regretthis is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish pentup anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor but also can be used to show a repressed man shy and shutout to the world around hima man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punchdrunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on 911 that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result he became reclusive and started to believe he couldnt remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him those that love him try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family he goes through life with his ipod and headphones shutting out everything so as not to be tempted rememberreign over me is not about charlie fineman though it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie by chance one day his life evolves into something he hasnt felt in 15 years he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family cheadles character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandlers doesnt mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives once they begin opening up though it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the faade they have created for themselvesthe supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective even writerdirector mike binders role as sandlers old best friend and accountant my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere considering it is his film last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows she is a great actress and plays the love crushed divorce trying to put her life back together wonderfully a role that seems comic relief at first but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to comebinder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time the direction is almost flawless the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore background really annoyed me in the beginning the acting superb and the story true to itself never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance not to lead us emotionally why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end i dont know but it did unfortunately stick out for me reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope,1,1,positive,
i am a huge fan of say anything jerry maguire and almost famous i wasnt that big on singles so its safe to say that i look forward to anything that cameron crowe attaches his name to i went to see vanilla sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that i probably wouldnt like it if i was expecting anything similar to crowes other films well having just seen it let me say that the former was correct and the latter couldnt have been more wrong it is a very weird movie and nothing really comes together until the end anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory anyway the movie was stellar and i look forward to owning it as soon as the dvd is released i was moved by the film and felt emotionally spent by the end this is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion if the viewer allows himherself into the plot in the theatre in which i saw the movie there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot im sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this i dont mean that to sound pompous but some people are more cut out for the seagal chan van damme genre of movies and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie it is very cerebral so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender as well as much thought afterwardsas far as comparing this film to other crowe movies it is very similar in at least one regard in all crowe movies the soundtrack is a character unto itself this is almost definitely due to crowes longstanding ties to music as anyone who has seen almost famous knows and to his marriage to heart star nancy wilson it was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between tom cruises acting and crowes directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen jerry maguire in my mind that is not a bad thinganyway if i had to compare this movie to any one other film i would say this if you enjoyed david finchers the game you will almost certainly be a fan of vanilla sky,1,0,positive,

my summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votesjust 21 short of making it eligible to be on imdbs infamous bottom 100 listthe 100 lowest rated films on the website with a paltry score of only 18 this would place the film at approximately between 38 and 46 on the listtalk about a very dubious achievement my score of 3 isnt that badbut it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded listas for the film it stars the oncecute aaron carteryet another prepackaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s when he first broke onto the scene he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to preteens and tweeners on radio disney his songs look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trickleading to some huge album sales unfortunately by 2005 sales were in decline and carter had hit his awkward stage of lifesomething all kids his age have to deal with eventually to put it bluntly he isnt cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life i assume now hes a gorgeous young manbut in popstar hes no longer the heartthrob he once was here he is just very normala death sentence for a kid in his position as a pop sensationinterestingly the film has some appearances by some other exteen heartthrobs from the last few decadesincluding a roles for david cassidy and leif garretttwo guys who also know what its like to disappear from the limelight cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself while garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke hopefully carter will take after cassidy in the future and so far thankfully hes managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many expop idols i was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department its not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid1990sin this film carter doesnt exactly need to stretch himselfhe plays a pop star however despite making millions and being adored by girls he doesnt have it all hes quite densemostly because he has little interest in learning the problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school himforcing him to go to public school the problem though is that he is rather phobic about taking testsand making the grade in school is difficult so he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to dateone who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school he picks the cute but bookish jane alana austin and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme workthis plot by the way isnt bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like the brady bunch or a nickelodeon sitcom sure its predictable and you know that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt and he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her and by the end of the film all will be forgiven and theyll be a real couple but given good acting and competent direction this could be worth seeing for his teen fans as predictable isnt always bad and as it turned out this isnt exactly where the plot wentbut it was awfully closethere are a few good things i liked about the film seeing tom bosley and stella stevens playing janes grandparents was very nicetheir role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again also 1970s made for tv movie star andrew stevens appeared in the filmit was nice to see him againthough part of me hated him as he looks so great after all these years and i look ever bit of my 45 years he did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother stellaas for carter with his many prior experiences on tv he was not surprisingly pretty good while his relationship with jane didnt seem very believable he and ms austin gave it their best the film wasnt great but they did try and i think most of the problems with the film were in the writingwith a better and less formulaic plot it could have worked much better plus the whole testophobia angle seemed pretty contrivedand rather insignificant who cares if a megamillionaire star gets anxious taking tests in school overall not a rotten film as the current rating would imply though there isnt much here to attract a wide audience people who grew up loving carter probably will enjoy the film older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably havent heard of him for them there is no nostalgia value in the filmmy favorite part of the filmleif garrett giving aaron advice i felt like screaming dont listen but didnt,0,0,positive,
funny that i find myself forced to review this movie but here i ami am reviewing it because just recently i have had the chance to witness the revival of rc sheriffs play journeys end on stage in new york at the belasco theatre starring hugh darcy boyd gaines jefferson mays and others as well as being masterfully directed by david grindleyi left the theater shattered i am not exaggerating i was flabbergasted after almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic depiction of soldiers life in the trenches of the somme i speculate during world war one brought to life vividly by everyone involved i came out of the theater with the shakesmind you i am not easily shocked nor am i too sensitive i am a stage actor and a director myself so i know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects both emotionally as well as psychologicallybut what i had just witnessed came so much to life that i had chills in my spine as i leftnone of these emotions came to life while watching aces high the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen in cooperation with rc sheriff himself shortly before he diedthe screen adaptation takes place in the skies over france so gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start withthe only plus of the movie are the aerial battle scenes which look dated in their special effects compared to todays standards but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screengranted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of all quiet on the western front by erich maria remarque which takes place in trenches and not in the sky but that was the german vision on things if one would like to be picky on such thingsjourneys end is just the other side of the medal and would have made it into a great movie if they had left it alone and intactthe transfer on dvd is poor even though in widescreen and adapted for 169 tv screens the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater nothing more nothing less it sports various defects such as minor scratches and dots although the copy for the rest is cleanif you want another wwi movie in your collection especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among oldtimers then this is a picture for you but i rather would suggest von richthofen and brown as an alternative although that too is a movie filled with inaccuraciesfor the rest of you who love good acting and drama i would leave this one out buy the play go watch the play if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you but keep off this wouldbe adaptationit is an antiwar movie granted but the weakest i have ever seen in my lifetime everthe presence of actors such as trevor howard ray milland richard johnson and john gielgud is just a bluff since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the moviemcdowell the very talented christopher plummer simon ward and peter firth all deliver very weak performances not due to their lack of skills but rather due to lack of true and solid directionthere are too many gaps in it and as said before it drags itself to the dubious end dubious because in the original play none of the men we come to know and sympathize with stay alive they are all killed in a fatal and futile mission in the movie they all die except malcolm mcdowell who manages somehow to stay alive another day being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost causethe end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness you just hear the cannons roar the machine guns rattle and grenade impacts throughout the theater then suddenly total peace and silence the curtain comes up lights and here they all are lined up standing straight and rigid obedient corpsesfar more interesting and far more shocking than aces high finale which is also dragged by the hairit is up to you to judgefor me if i had the money and the contacts to do so i would take the play and develop it the way it was meant adding here and there some action scene in the field just to visualize the outer horror and slaughter going on in the vasty fields of france around the men involved but then just strictly concentrating on what is going on in that tiny shack at the edge of sanity and the worldwant such a moviethen ask for itthis is not it,0,-1,positive,

when i saw this movie for the first time i was both surprised and a little shocked by the blatant vibrance of the story it is a very artistic drama with incredible special effects spectacular acting not to mention a very excellent job in the makeup department jennifer lopez has pulled herself out of past roles that dug into her career with this movie portraying a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to enter the minds of comatose patients to treat them vincent donofrio played amazingly well his portrayal of a sadist serial killer was perfect to a t the sheer emotion conveyed by his performance is astounding vince vaughn isnt my favorite but still performed exceptionally well the symbolism and artistry was intriguing and titillating sometimes surprising and other times shocking overall i say this is a wonderful movie with excellent acting and beautiful artwork,1,1,positive,
for a movie i was really looking forward to i was very disappointed i had no expectations of this being another amadeus but did expect a more significant portrayal of beethovens last yearsthe performance by ed harris was superb but the story line was so weak that the film simply moved from one dreary scene to the next with no continuitythe only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th and from that point on i could quite happily have walked out without finishingi left feeling very dissatisfied and still have the feeling that something important was missed,0,1,neutral,

this review is based on the producers cut halloween 5 was a major disappointment at the box office way back in 89 personally ive always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection but because of its failure and also because of rights issues it would be 6 years before we would see another installment the film had the makings of being one of the best if not the best in the series a hardcore fan writing the script the return of not only donald pleasence as dr loomis and george wilbur as michael myers but also the return of the character of tommy doyle from the first film a major studio backing the project and a fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making so what went wrong ill give you two good reasons reshoots and poor editing due to a bad test screening and also the unfortunate passing of donald pleasence the film was changed and not for the better the film like parts iii and 5 tanked at the box office and earned negative reviews from both critics and most series fans but then thanks to the magic of bootlegging the original cut leaked out and many fans including my self were very happy i will end this portion of my review by saying this this film is so far at least my favorite halloween film and im not afraid to admit thatpros the score is simply spellbinding has some of the best writing and dialogue of the series halloween 4 emulated the original in that it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts and 6 is the same way great performances especially from the late and very missed donald pleasence moves at a breathtaking pace an interesting explanation for michaels evil and why he wont die some brutal kills some pretty chilling moments my favorite being the one involving kim darbys character a lot of really cool nods to the previous films some good surprises like the previous two sequels this one has an awesome cliffhanger endingcons though the explanation for michaels evil is fascinating it does make him a little less scary since when can michael move around from place to place so fast final thoughts this was the first halloween that i saw in the theatre i was so excited because i really had thought 5 would be the last and then i heard this was happening i enjoyed it at the time but over time i saw it for what it really was a great movie trapped in an ok one with a terrible ending why did the filmmakers have to listen to the people at the test screenings if they had released this superior version it may have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess its in right nowmy rating 55,1,0,positive,
while flipping through the channels on a late saturday night my friends and i stumbled across this film first of all irish actor pierce brosnan as a native american seriously his accent was breaking through so much although his character was apparently scottish next i was stunned to find that this film was made after he had already played james bondagent 007 at least twice this movie plays up the stereotypes with the inspiring professor figure the girl who played pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut and this film won an award i cannot believe it brosnan is an attractive man but we seriously wanted to gauge our eyes out after watching this for just 10 seconds we switched from kicking and screaming to this and we wanted to switch back we watched the 1995 childrens classic the indian in the cupboard earlier in the night which also discussed the iroquois the following line represents our desire to run away take me outside earth grasper from grey owl if you dont like it you dont have to watch,0,-1,neutral,

sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie i had had a trauma after watching welcome 2007 and thought that they wont do it again but after loads of amazing promos tashan finally ended as heart attacksuch amazing 3 songs in promo dil haara chhaliya and tashan mein and what u get in the movie zero story predictable plot plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight lossmusicwise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they havent thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts that song is such nice quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album if you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like bachchan bachchan pandeyoverall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad englishgo away man i need to puke,0,-1,positive,
this is the battlefield earth of mini series it has with a few exceptions all the disastrous ingredients that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery they are both adaptations of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director in this case they are the same person who clearly dont know what they are doing they have both a messiah wannabe that dont really deliver as a hero played in this case by a guy that looks like mark hamill but sadly the force is not with him and a bunch of stupid bad guys who likes to betray and mess up the life for each other they are both containing scenes stolen from better productions and they are both cheap productions who tries to look expensive with some often badly made computer animation the exceptions that actually makes the whole thing worse is the terrible work made by the lighting guy who dont even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room the camera work that for no reasons at all sometimes are in tilted battlefield earth mode but for the most of the time are flat as a pancake the extremely cheap and to small desert set that only contents a pile of sand in the front of a backdrop painted as a desert that turns very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene and the bad idea by the costume designer to try to mimic the fifth elements fashion madness with the addition of the silliest hats ever made silly moments to remember 1 every scene with the guild guys who looks like mst3ks observer guys but with silly hats 2 irulan shows up at the party dressed in her butterfly dress why butterflys was the one with stuffed parrots in the cleaner with matching silly hat together with a couple of guys with silly balloon hats 3 paul the standup comedian 4 baron harkonnen in over acting overdrive screaming im alive 5 every scene with the backdrop because it newer fits the foreground 6 every scene with the fremens fake religious cermonies specially the water of life cermony 7 the battle scenes where the same guys gets killed a couple times and the same things explodes over and over again it is a lot more but it is a 1000 words limit on this so i better stop before i gets carried away,0,0,negative,
this is a great filmi first saw this film when it came out i just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it a lot of films we watched when we were younger dont seem to hold up when we watch them later in life the film is actually a great 80s example of the type of films made then keaton is at his best all the actors actually did a very good job and ron howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it the pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80s is too funny being from the 80s i loved seeing the ugly pacer again the film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80s film lovers,1,1,positive,
during 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that lily powersbarbara stanwyck would do anything to obtain great wealth and power lilys father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on lily as the story progresses lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president it is great to see a very young john wayne jimmy mccoy jr who was only 25 when this picture was produced and jimmy did not even get to first base with lily not even for lunch a very young george brent coutland trenholm stars along with barbara stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances this is a great film from 1933 which was produced by darryl f zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen this film is rather mild compared to what we view on the hollywood screens today but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film enjoy,1,1,positive,

i will never forget when i saw this title in the video store way back when i was always a big weird al fan and when i saw this video i rented and watched it i was too young to appreciate all of als subtle humor and satire at the time but i remember it much later when i was old enough to understand what i was watching if you are an al fan especially of his earlier work you will thoroughly enjoy this film it is done in the mtvesque rockumentary style and tells a true but sometimes exaggerated tale of how al got to be where he was in 1985 you will love it if you like his brand of humor and more importantly his music,1,-1,positive,
well where do we start there was a lot of potential for this film with such big stars playing a role but the whole story was ruined by a horrific plot this movie did not pan out to be what i would expect the good guy makes it out alive i mean co mon nobody wants the good guy to be successful the ending was cringe worthy and very clich no thought what so ever you got the plot all wrong the bad guys are meant to come out successfulif you want to waste 1 hour and 2 minutes of your time spend it doing something else this movie was the epitome of crap i really think the actors did this movie for some quick vegas cash no doubt about it save your money watch a better movie,0,0,negative,
yes i spelled that right this movie is so predictable the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability from the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced it is paintbynumbers as to where this plot will take us the foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer you could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the endingcatherine zetajones and aaron eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and abigail breslin played the cute role admirably its just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre the romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few sure its an ok movie if you have nothing to watch but you wont miss anything by missing this one,0,-1,neutral,
on the outside this film is better because of vincent donofrio law order criminal intent but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version in some ways the 1999 version is better because its more up to date a decade as compared to the 27 years the actors in this film were great like terry kinney mcmanus of hbos oz as james daly and tony shalhoub usas monk and gary sinise csiny obvilubuly dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences nut much of the writing remained the same there were stuff that wasnt in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy but in the end this film was just as great at the 1982 one characterwise vincent donofrio playing phil romano was excellent better that paul sorvino its a match up between stacy keach and terry kinney in terms of james as for george i would praise shalhoub and between martin sheen sinsise as tom i would say sinise wins,1,1,positive,
what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers the premise may sound familiar the watchmen unbreakable however the russian scifi action flick the sword bearer is far from the standard stockthe story revolves around a man named sasha who as a boy was shunned from society his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess when he wishes or his anger allows a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin very wolverinish maybe but thats not the interesting part of this film shunned all his life and driven by anger and a temper he does have our hero returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flames new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is aboutthe film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences this is art house at its core beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome scifi action its this odd mash that interests me so much in this film the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of sasha and not a straight action film dont worry though the action is there and plenty of it however much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath this is not to say that action is not shown these scenes are here and are fantastic especially the ending where we see sashas full powers unleashed in desperation the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the characters emotional struggle at hand this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre,1,1,positive,
seldom do i give up on a movie without seeing the entire show this is particularly true when i have rented it on dvd syriana was one in which i did give up half way through i turned it off in bored disgustthis movie is disjointed boring confusing and lackluster the acting was dry and without credible portrayals the general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest the multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop i cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award,0,0,positive,

if you enjoy suspense this movie has it the fact that marina zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense alec guinesss appearance was nice but didnt really add to the movie im not sure if evan richards part as andy clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot i thought the cinematography was excellent this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well the bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done i would call it overall good entertainment,1,1,positive,

one of the biggest hits of 1926 brown of harvard is a exciting comedydrama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star its patented haines all the way brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a manhero and wins the girl no one worked this formula like haines a terrific comic actor little annie rooney with mary pickford show people with marion davies haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines with lon chaney and west point with joan crawford where he repeats the formula mary brian is good as the girl jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate ralph bushman is the rival edward connelly mary alden david torrence guinn williams and grady sutton costar this film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john waynes film debut as a yale football player but i never spotted him haines was a topfive box office star starting with this picture through 1932 its a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time,1,-1,neutral,
sometimes lady luck smiles on me i had originally made and copied over a vhs tape of this wonderful tv presentation i was heartbroken when i realized what i had done since i had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere elserecently i subscribed to digital cable and while searching through upcoming movies there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie this time however i made a copy of it to dvd so theres no chance of repeating my mistakei finally got to watch it again after eight years and it was just as exciting and tense as when i first saw it there is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with pandoras clock came with a live reading of the book on public radio i just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch and from the first installment i was hooked each day i waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be readwhen i learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on tv as a movie i made sure to clear my schedule for that eventfirst of all id like to say that the movie was very true to the book contrary to what another reviewer had said that in itself is a rare achievement for tv moviessecondly i agree with others about the casting i could not imagine a better choice for captain holland than richard dean anderson literally the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role anderson has never been better and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him in fact all of the cast members did a superb jobmy only complaint with the movie and the book was the interjection of the terrorist plot to arm a private business jet with airtoair missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane basically we are talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one and folks that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one then two of its engines blown offthat beef aside i enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film as well as our ownif you have an opportunity to see this movie do so by all means,1,1,positive,

well this was my first imax experience so i was pretty blown away about that primarily although with hindsight i cant help wishing that it had been some other less monochromefilmmagnificent desolation very much had the programme for schools feel the way it listed all the astronauts and this made it feel a lot like reading national geographic magazine in 3d weirdly it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time it felt like some powerpoint presentation there was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens seemingly at your feel that had a bit of a wow factor but to be honest that may have had more to do with me being an imax virginthe commentary provided by tom hanks i personally found very whats a nice way to put it flagwavingly nationalistic which didnt go down too well in central london judging by remarks overheard as we leftover all i loved the imax experience but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day the moon isnt a particularly colourful subject and to be honest a lot of the 3d effects were lost in the monochrome scenery all that would have been well were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with american schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit,0,-1,positive,

not just because of that theme in the movie which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot noi watched this knowing i would not like it i hate numerology whenever someone starts going off about patterns with numbers i feel the urge to slap them my own brain starts hurting out of empathy and fully aware this is a movie just about that topic i couldnt resist the urge to watch it and maybe get a good laugh but it wasnt funny just exactly the dumb sort of isnt this totally scary and yet amazingly cool i can turn any crap into 23 dialog i was afraid of as soon as the son started to chime in i knew this movie is a turd no matter what happens but i hardly ever stop watching a movie i started i sat through it i enjoy the painthe movie pretends to mock numerology under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly but it rides that wave as much as its supposed to crush it i dont see that message i only see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify top that off with the usual surprises trying to put another twist to throw you off that makes no sense and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narration up to there and you get one hollow piece of moviemaking that just happens to be centered around the topic i despise if only it did not try to be serious and rather had been some hilarious movie with actors i dont give a damn about but i was starting to like carreywhile its not his fault he is trying its not even good for watching with a bunch of friends and mst3k the hell out of itmy expectations were low enough for someone to trip on them but this movie managed to live up to be one of the worst ive ever seen,0,0,positive,

there are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film suffice it to say that alex cord plays a strong lead opposite robert ryan and arthur kennedy what concerns me is that many of you may not be aware of the at least two existing versions of this film in the us version clay mccord gains amnesty from governor lem carter and then rides out of town redeemed i agree that ending is less than satisfying however in the original italian cut clay mccord rides out of town weaponless as he has turned in his pistols to the governor and is bushwhacked by the bounty hunters that have been slowly depopulating the bandit town of escondido the bounty killers are excited at the prospect of splitting the 10000 reward but are disappointed to find mccords amnesty agreement in the corpses pocket as they ride away one is heard to commentif this amnesty keeps up im gonna start hunting buffalo this alone takes a minute to praya second to die and places it on an even playing field with movies like keoma and the big gundown as the end credits say in the italian cut fine,1,-1,neutral,
im usually not too into a specific show save for the oc desperate housewiveshey i am 20 but no kidding after one episode of reunion i was hookedi cant even say how bummed i was that its timeslot conflicted with bushs speech last night because i was really looking forward to the 1987 episode which will now air next thursday again that conflict was disadvantageous because being a new show it needs to build up a following and having the second episode pushed back a week kills some momentumthat said tv doesnt always have to be emmy worthy to be enjoyable i dont expect reunion to take home any prizes but i do expect it will be able to capture my attention all season ever watch the first few episodes of a beloved show years later sometimes you wonder how you ever got hooked character building takes some timethe one episode for each year idea is wonderful in my opinion the only other show i can recall doing something similar is 24 with each episode being an hourand having an eventful year is more realistic than a day that eventful please give this show a shot relax about art formits just tv,1,1,positive,

yeah a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction now its a prison again kind of well its more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits so i guess in that way its like a prison not really though when sasha steven seagals character is being admitted into prison hes standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend like hes in line for the security check at the airport then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches smacking around a couple of security guardslet me tell you something you assault a corrections officer in a federal prison theyll shoot you on the spot ja rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch oh and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot in prison federal prisonyou cant dress like that at most high schools in americaspeaking of ja rule i have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth including ja rule himself had to have been 50 cent just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest celebrity feuds ever and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 cent who had lived the thug life for real and ja rule who had not every time i saw ja rule on screen the only thing i could picture was 50 cent laughing his ass off ja rule looks like a rowdy 9yearold every time he appears on screenanyway getting back to the plot its funny sasha is an fbi agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization hes sentenced to five years and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes nothing else in the movie matters after that it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences most of which arent even well choreographedoh how about this a helicopter crashes through the roof of new alcatraz at one point accidentally freeing all of the inmates and what do they do they all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block without so much as a basket they had a ball but it doesnt matter the scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotchso some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in alcatrazs state of the art execution chamber evidently not for stealing 200 million dollars in gold but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caughthey good thinking people if you cant get information out of someone kill them thats a great way to learn the truth so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the 200 million for themselvesoh and the 200 million is in gold bricks i doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currencytheres also the issue of the warden at the prison hes some toughtalking vato who thinks hes a hardcore chollo from the barrio which reminds me of a joke i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense these people go to mexico the comedian says and theyre like oh my god people live there thats like a total shackthe best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men cant carry their guns inside his prison i dont care if she is a united states supreme court justicethis woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks hes in charge haand by the way the supreme court justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53 thats a year younger than steven seagal i just thought that was funnythe only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where ja rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little asian woman that was the funniest thing ive seen in a movie in a long long timeyou know i work for the company that produced this film which i why i watched it and i still dont have a single positive thing to say about it except of course for that one scene with ja rule getting spanked by that asian womanso read my review of malena and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film critics like roger ebert but in his review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else hes ever writteni imagine the flywheels at the mpaa congratulating each other on a good days work as they rated half past dead pg13 after giving the antigun movie bowling for columbine an rway to go guys,0,-1,positive,
i loved this series when it was on kids wb i didnt believe that there was a batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997 first of all i loved the idea of robin leaving batman to solve crime on his own it was an interesting perspective to their relationship i also liked the addition of tim drake in the series and once again like its predecessor this show had great story lines great animation better then the original fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing the only thing that i didnt like was that was when it was in the us it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline i just wish some of the episodes could be longer my favorite episode of any batman cartoons comes in this series and its called over the edge in my opinion as good if not better then heart of ice and robins reckoning overall a nice follow up along with superman this show made my childhood very happy,1,1,positive,
i first saw martins day when i was just 10 years old at home on the movie channel and still remember the impact it made on my life it touched me as no other film had touched me and i remember balling my eyes outafter the first time i saw it i couldnt find it anywhere else i would ask around and no one had ever heard of the film i guess it was one of those more rare films that not many people knew about because no one and i mean no one knew what i was talking about i searched and searched throughout the years checking video stores shelves and scanning cable tv listings but always came up short finally in 1996 i found out i could special order it i did and have probably watched it at least 50 times sinceand it still makes me cry every timemartins day is about martin steckert a man who is in prison but genuinely a good guy who yearns to make it back to the special lake where he grew up as boy this was a special place where he lived off nature spent time with his dog and was left alone to enjoy life soon into the movie he escapes and starts making his way back to the lakeit isnt long before the cops find him and steckert grabs a child as a hostage to convince the police to back off soon steckert and his hostage the 2nd martin become best friends and have many fun adventures togetherfrom robbing a toy truck to hijacking a train all on the way to this special lakethroughout the movie steckert has great flashbacks of him at the lake as a boyi wont ruin the ending for you but i will tell you this movie is a must see it is the best movie i have ever seen in my life i am without a doubt the biggest fan of this movie ever i managed to find the song that the two martins are singing throughout the movie im going back to where i come from im even planning a trip to canada to see the lake and cottage where martins day was filmed crazy i knowbut that movie just means so much to me,1,1,positive,
first id like to say that while i know my share about star wars i am not a fanatic i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427 what i know is this star wars all the moviesless so with episode 2 though captured something magical its hard to say what what button lucas has found and boldly pressed but it works star wars is more than a movie its an ideahow may you ask i shall explain star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes good vs evil it does this so obviously so profoundly that literally any person from any environment can understand episode vi does the very well concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father yet also with the addition of the prequels reveals even more to the hinted back story suddenly its darth vader at the front and viewers realize that its the story about anakin not just luke but even before 13 there was amazing depth to it all it felt real as if capsule fell from the sky into lucass lap detailing a historical account of a galaxy far far awaystar wars is definitely something far above the norm and i must admit whenever i see them particularly this one i feel very small i feel as though ive been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined i get a tingling feeling when i see them a feeling that something somehow has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope,1,1,positive,
i experienced nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the resultsclive barker is said to have revitalised horror with hellraiser but this is a film that effectively stalled his cinema career somewhat what an unfortunate thing to happen because like the inhabitants of midian this film seems to be misunderstoodbarker has created a crossbreed of genre staples in this story it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fable regarding mans inhumanity to man evoking sympathy for the devil is tough at the best of times but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this film it becomes nigh on impossible cue the child the practically klanlike human insurgence pitchforks and holy wrath at the films conclusion becomes doubly upsetting in the face of what has gone before as a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy this film can be quite evocativei pity those who will not see the film from this angle and think of it as barkers fantastical indulgence gone too far we have a genuine forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and mr barker make nice and devote some time to it the better,1,1,positive,

this movie is more like a music video kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies the best thing in promise me this is the music written by stribor kusturicakusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise promise me this has very little noisei liked life is a miracle it was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot promise me this has no plot i was awaiting this movie with big expectations because ive read that the script has been written by ranko bozic one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in life is a miracle ranko bozic writes great dialogues but for kusturica they are noise and much to my regret i saw only two dialogues which i could identify as written by ranko bozic the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son striborgordan mihic the man who wrote the scripts for time of the gypsies and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica never follows the script black cat white cat was the only script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it according to gordan mihic after all kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesnt he doesnt make a good movie and i think this is the case with promise me this he should have followed the script of ranko bozicpromise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh the comedic moments are in the same style as black cat white cat but are not that funny at all i think the difference comes from the fact that black cat white cat was written by gordan mihichowever i know some people who liked promise me this they find it very positive movie,0,1,positive,

the premise to this movie was one which focused on the polarization of of ideologies in the united states this was a highly combustible scenario in america whereby two entirely different cultures collided what justified such heinously depraved actions anyway as this film presents the scenewhile hickock and smith drank these two men were not intoxicated nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs it was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation basically these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect anytime past 1975 we as a nation have nurtured an empathy for deviates who have been victimized by their environment however this incident takes place in 1959 this dreadful revelation sideswiped us and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics with the recent release of the movie capote based on truman capote who was the creator of the documentary in cold blood the american people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film robert blake played the role of perry smith one of the villains in this movie this is seemingly appropriate given the notoriety he has been involved with concerning his personal life in cold blood centers on the element of the unexplained there was no vengeance involved there was no material gain to be acquired there was no potential for social advancement here either this is merely an instance of a latent and insidiously belligerent anger which ends certainly did not justify the means the situational diatribes which hickock and smith lamented about were always ambiguous under the circumstances why then should they take their frustrations out on an anonymously unsuspecting and innocent kansas family will geer grandpa walton plays the prosecuting attorney who is sickened by this act of macabre capriciousness his argument is thoroughly convincing his contention being these two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours this is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if i were to be one of the members of the jury absolute disdain for your precarious plight in life does not serve as vindication for orchestrating a capital crime it was capotes instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the american publics attention as it turn out it was a harbinger of things to come in cold blood did just that this incident was the calm before the storm relating to a pertinent aspect of emergence to the radical 1960s such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical americans for the futuretruman capote does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book which was a best seller and with this documentary as well the acting in this film by robert blake and scott wilson as well as people like john forsythe was incredible the director richard brooks cat on a hot tin roof blackboard jungle elmer gantry and key largo to name but a few was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie i think that in cold blood is one of the best films in the history of movies the film depicts two reprehensible spawns of depravity who delved into demented theatrics and wound up captivating a trite gratification for being acknowledged at a pejorative nationwide level this movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence our nations ideologies are incredibly different now than they were in 1959 this movie introduces the american people to the emotional and vacillating culprits who initiated such a precarious metamorphosis in our overall value system i recommend to everyone that they see this moviein cold blood was the focal point to the film capote think about it making a movie about a movie constitutes a rare and coveted accolade in hollywood in the case of in cold blood it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant intellectually elevating and of course it goes without saying in cold blood was utterly spellbinding as well as a totally remarkable movie,1,1,positive,

since the past couple of days im really hooked on the female scorpion series and i keep hitting myself over the head because i waited until now which is way too long before purchasing the whole box set beast stable is the third brilliant effort in a row and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment never before or after has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines settings themes and filming styles the original more or less qualified as a socalled womeninprison flick but already an atypical one but you cant possibly categorize parts 2 and 3 as such since they hardly feature any footage within prison walls and the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well the first film was harsh and gritty whereas the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mainly melodramatic dont let this last description discourage you however as beast stable still features more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage in spite of the dramatic ambiance the opening sequence for example is downright fantastic sasori still a fugitive from the law literally chops her way to freedom on the subway when theres no other possibility than to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman that handcuffed her her run through the city with the cutoff arm dangling on hers while the credits appear on screen accompanied by the familiar theme song is just pure and genuine exploitation gold the story compellingly continues with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city but the poor thing simply cant escape her past or even new types of agony sasori befriends a prostitute though without exchanging dialog and takes on a job in a sewing atelier her own retarded brother impregnates the prostitute while sasori gets in trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network she cleverly prevents a thug from taking advantage of her body encounters a former enemy from prison and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she gets submitted to a barbaric abortion meanwhile the onearmed cop continues to obsessively prowl the streets looking for retribution against sasori our multitalented director shunya ito formidably crisscrosses all these story lines to a powerful wholesome and never once loses grip on the visual aspects or ingenious filming style beast stable features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine the editing is flawless and the exterior locations are effectively depressing those who know sasoris character a bit are aware that the film seriously lacks memorable dialogs but this always gets widely compensated with meiko kajis wondrous on screen charisma and menacing grimaces theres very little sleaze apart from the aforementioned incestuous sub plot but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words in fact i think part three might just be the greatest or at least my favorite one of the series so far my only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is regarding the ridiculous sounds one of the birds produces when sasori is locked up in a cage that bird sounds like a ventriloquists dummy with stomach cramps,1,1,positive,
mikhail kalatozovs the cranes are flying is a superb film winner of the golden palm at cannes film festival it has an excellent cinematography and performance by tatyana samojlova the only russian actor ever to win an award in cannes for a performance she plays veronika a teenager in love with her boyfriend happy and without preoccupations with plans of getting married her life will get upside down when world war ii strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army the film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight waiting for a letter or other information it is a portrayal of lost innocence samojlova does a magnificent job and her character transformation will break your heart the camera movement is fast with a lot of closeups it is a dancing camera the first scene in the stairs is fantastic but it isnt the only one there is later a scene when veronika attempts committing suicide and another in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history the bombing of veronikas house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire to find her apartment completely destroyed simply great 10 out of 10,1,1,positive,

it opens and for half an hour runs like an educational programme on the old testament although not without humour the movie finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant gets dropped in a scene of mixed success martin donovan jesus decides to renege on kicking off the apocalypse and the final quarter of an hour is a sort of humanist whats all the fuss about playout gilded with optimistic conjecture against a retrospectively miserably ironic long shot of the wtc twin towersapart from donovans authority the acting is split theres the thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast this though formally contrived for biblical presentation is appropriate for the modern paranoid comedy that hartleys aiming at but i was also pleasantly surprised at the contribution of pj harvey credited thus and in danger of existing within the film solely as the pop star entity she is not least in a set piece scene in a record store and a perilously patchy soundtrack to which contributes she remained cool a sort of disingenuous lack of focus in the manner of many pop icons who have taken to film im thinking the jagger of performance here but nonetheless maintained a convincing integration with both cast and projectultimately affirmative but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and relies more on the perseverance than the imagination of its audience 410,0,-1,neutral,
some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough well if you regard it as an action movie this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting however i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action onethe movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences tomas beccket who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills looked as if he was coldhearted however after beccket showed his day dream of montana we can clearly see his softness inside it was the cruel war and his partners sacrifice that made beccket become so called coldheartedmillar on the contrary was a new comer a green hand and was even not qualified as a sniper billy zane did quite well to show millars hesitation and fear when he first tried to put a bullet through ones heartas what beccket said what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the awardthese two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities these two snipers quarreled suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the othersniper isnt a good action movie but a good psychological one,1,-1,neutral,

for three quarters of an hour the story gradually develops towards a pivotal point of some sort although it is overburdened with scenes that just seem to be intended to dull the viewer and lure him away from the actual plot there is something happening it is not much and it certainly is not obvious the combination of palace impressions and storydriving scenes do not add any depth or insight to the whole cast of characters in fact they keep them sterile as there is no character development at all everybody just remains spinning and centered around their own clich and role the cute kinda headstrong girl the fighting berwoman the snobby aristocrat the male lead does not seem to have any distinction at all he is a shallow presence which actually doesnt even matter as he is only there because the storyboard required him to it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught up when the point comes of turning the corner in terms of what happening the movie first snaps completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous it solves or better dissolves itself with a bythebook deus ex machina more clichs and some of the most crude plot devices and choices i have ever seen its history alright first the movies a drama though its supposed to be comedic and then it turns into a farce the protagonists do what they are expected to do and there are no surprises the first set of somewhat serious antagonists however gets replaced by a couple that literally was just bored maybe that was some kind of nod towards the audiencethis movie does not get any bonus from me for underlying philosophical meaning since there is none nor for its technical realization the animation and editing is fair and sos the sound mixing but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average japanese productions of the late 1980s in fact the visual treats seem static uninspired and unoriginalworst of all it totally fails to entertain even if you dont bother with characters and all that stuff theres too little going on here and the rest is corny at best get a real ghibli instead have a feast with it and keep your fingers off this one,0,-1,positive,

i picked this film up from the local family video on sale for 150 which was probably the first sign it wasnt going to be good watching it with 2 friends neither of them even wanted to finish it because of how awful this movie is i strangely couldnt stop watching it but this film is definitely a textbook case of how not to make a moviethe plot is simple enough and sounds great chuck norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind bars the serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to become reality once more serial murder norris roundhouse kicks this sounds like a great filmand some of it is pretty good the flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense a scene where a van cascades off a cliff and gets crushed is amazing and i learned how to break out of prison using nothing more than chapstick gun powder and dental floss but there is plenty wrong with this movieone the editor is a moron when making an action or suspense film you have to keep the energy moving there are far too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot left in this movie slowing it down and distracting from the overall story at least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pacing would have improved and the film would be slightly better two the sound guy is a moron apparently somebody tried to film most of this movie in an area where you cant get decent sound so most of the dialog is voiced over killing the stereo and not lining up with mouths also the music is far too dramatic in some scenes three the casting director is a moron they cast billy drago as a psychiatrist billy drago is a great cult actor from brisco county the hills have eyes and others and would have made the proper serial killer or some sort of villain his character is so vanilla that dragos skills are wasted four the writer is a moron two plots are in this film the hunting of a serial killer and the romance between norris and his pregnant girlfriend every time i saw that woman on screen i wanted to claw my eyes out and sure enough she never figured into the other plot making her story completely pointlesswill i ever watch this again maybe but unless they remaster this film at least a dozen times you never should not recommended,0,1,positive,

the luzhin defence is a movie worthy of anyones time it is a brooding intense film and kept my attention the entire time john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender eccentric chess grandmaster and emily watson is spellbinding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story all in all this movie is one of the best indepth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster and turturro and watson add a whole nonmainstream noncliche feel to the film most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories,1,1,positive,

bela lugosi is a real enigma in the early 1930s he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula yet again and again he made lousy decisions regarding his career perhaps he had a bad agent perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy regardless he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any filmranging from excellent horror films such as the raven to bigbudget flicks like ninotchka to gradez flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios interestingly enough although he agreed to do this terrible film he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein as for this movie it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteursnot a bad thing at all but at the end we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the americanlooking men he killed were actually japanese the funniest part of this is during a flashback you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to americanlike men when the camera scans them the men are clearly asian but on all the other noncloseup shots they are all very western lookingmany with bald heads they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men i suspect the plot must have undergone a rewrite and this might account for the obvious mistake or it could just be shoddy production values and editing in fact early in the film they show a street scene in the city and all the cars circa 1942 are old model t fordsobviously from stock footage the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull unlike plan 9 from outer space its hard to laugh at the ineptitudejust be put to sleep by it,0,0,positive,

to date this is still the worst piece of rubbish ive ever viewed so annoyed i even complained to blockbuster for stocking it me and some friends rented it after looking at the back cover thinking we were in for a good horror film the plot line seem to change during the film and there was lots of irrelevant padding the film ended quite abruptly im guessing they ran out of film sound quality was dire and the first female character had a very thick spanish accent although she talked utter nonsense anyway the guy provided a brief bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts at murder after wasting all the time to go into indepth discussion on the workshop and its many power tools he opts to put a plastic bag over her head all in all on second thoughts i think you have to watch this film to actually believe it exists,0,0,negative,

neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers but then nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew especially one using the gangsterconartist movie framework as might be expected from luc bessons name on the credits as producer theres a definite element of cinema de look about it set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap it looks great has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck and hes spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life the universe and everything if anything its problem is that hes trying to throw in too many influences a bit of machiavelli a dash of godard a lot of the principles of chess motifs and techniques littering the screen with quotes the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didnt want to turn into a movie rather than a commercial for kabbalism its really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the films central somewhat metaphysical conthe last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy literally within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast peoples exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger but its got a lot going for it all the same not worth starting a new religion over but im surprised it didnt get a us distributor maybe they found ray liottas intentionally fake tan just too damn scary,1,1,positive,

this is a movie that has all the basic elements of its genre it makes you wanna cry it makes you laugh it disgust you it makes you angry etc the topic of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drugs what is the common trend in gay themed movies in these days but it focuses on the social interactions between characters what could be considered not to be in the high school elite the play and the direction could be a little bit more sophisticated but on the other hand its somehow better so because it really shows the distress of the characters that they are experiencing if this was intended then this is a remarkable job and assuredly an achievement specially for such an young director its actually a good story that gives you a little inside into how it is to be a fat girl and to acknowledge it to yourself,1,-1,neutral,

man to man tries hard to be a good movie it has its heart at the right place it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate but there lies also some of the problems of this picture it strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic man to man doesnt let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head joseph fiennes exemplifies this in his role he does his best to look concerned genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that man to man is not worth watching but there are enough points to defend it it is entertaining has some humorous scenes and the showstealing kristin scott thomas of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like the elephant man david lynch but youll be leaving the theatre satisfied it tries to grab your heart even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious and succeeds most of the time,0,-1,positive,

this is such a fantastic movie a western about a selfconcerned man jimmy stewart going up to the klondike for gold on the way he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska john mcintire giving a wonderfully evil performance whom he hassles back mcintire threatens that hell be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town which is unfortunately the only way back to the states the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintires town ruth roman for instance who has come with stewart and his two companions jay c flippen and walter brennen who plays stewarts best friend builds a saloon a hollywood front for a whorehouse and tries to run the towns restaurant and hangout place out of business she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up too in 1953 jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre the naked spur the far country is just the tiniest bit less and it contains 999 of what made that film so special without of course feeling like a cheap copy like the naked spur the far country boasts beautiful onlocation cinematography the landscape is gorgeous stewart gives one of his best performances nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 rear window i suppose it could be considered cliche as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end still stewart plays it so damn well he makes this character very human and the supporting performances are universally fantastic in addition to those ive mentioned the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good and i ought to single out walter brennen as well he seems to have specialized in playing best friends his relationship with stewart is very touching since he is at first the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man the screenplay is very well written and manns direction is impeccable a masterpiece 1010,1,1,positive,

i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten before going to this movie the day after it came out i came on imdb to check out the comments a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog i never go by other peoples opinions so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie it had to be one of the worst movies ive ever seenthe person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff since when do scary movies have sappy scenes i swear im amazed there werent any group hug momentsi think i jumped once and thats because i zoned out thinking about my research paper for english the clichd birdscat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happenand the characters were stupid my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said i have to get my moms shawl you idiot screw the shawl safety is just a few steps away but no my moms shawl that didnt match the dress by the way is wayyyy more important than my health and safety and to top it all off they take her back to her house knowing that the killer knew where she lived godmy friend and i also predicted the entire movie and not just the i bet hes hiding under the bed moments it was the he stole the bellhops clothes and sneaked out of the hotel and its the detective coming down the hallway not the killer moments movies should never be this predictable disney movies arent even this predictableim gonna complete my rant now by saying this was a terrible movie im glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldnt buy it for 1500 and then hate it it was just bad it wouldve been better if only one thing wouldve happened if after being shot by the detective the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in knife in hand falling and stabbing the girl on his way down oh how lovely that wouldve beendont waste your time or money go see a good movie,0,0,positive,
well awful is just the first name this movie is a clichridden piece of junk a high school comedy setup in a military training camp im sorry i had to give this 1 star which it did not deservethis may contain spoilersjust about everything is totally forced unconvincing and unrealistic the hepo military police will not come to get you if you dont make your appearance especially not on your wedding day the actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene because the scene didnt work as it was so highly unlikely you can sense it in their voices even if they were not such bad actors they wouldnt have been able to save the scene next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit no there was no time to get him an uniform first man this is great cinematography i will remember this scene for the rest of my lifethere are also girls in the campexcitingone ofem even a model though not looking that greatand the baddest actress ive ever seen i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie okay girls in the military now this is getting fun the girls are even placed on the same floor so we can sneak to their room at night in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away separated by two fences with barbed wire there are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time of which we have plenty no the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted no one will notice the engine sounds especially not at nightthere is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line we need those so the sexually obsessed germans will like the movie as well switzerland is too small a market for any feature film well doneone sex scene takes place in the kitchen surely none of those facilities are ever locked the military routines are as sloppy as they can getin the end of the brainless flick the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him because he deserted his fiance sure i buy that the italians are that waya jealous bunch not the bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses not at night in a dark alley again military training grounds where there is shooting with live ammo are open to the public anyone can freely drive or walk in there there are no such things as guards or fences the deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the italians car the explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fiance off their feet no one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens its a comedy rememberokay its a comedy i got that and i can live with that no realism needed filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously side splitting funny or entertaining interesting challenging unfortunately it is none of those its just embarrassing a ripoff from brainless american comedies the latter are at least done professionally with no amateur actorsit is pretty boring and predictable a waste of time and energy especially to those sitting through the entire movie as i unfortunately did yawn,0,0,positive,
im a big fan of 50s scifi but this is not one of my favorites while the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper scifi flick the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie its clear he was working with no money because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever i have never seen so much timekilling in a moviethere are probably less than 60 seconds of blob footage in the entire movie and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorlywritten runon dialogue it was fun to see steve m and anita c together but good heavenshow could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers,0,0,negative,
i just wanted to inform anyone who may be interested that the the movie new jersey drive was my personal favorite off alltime i admire the work nick gomez and spike lee put into this masterpiece of a movie this movie made quite an impression on me because of its realness and its appreciation of detail of life in urban new jersey it struck a chord with me personally because i grew up with friends like those depicted in the movie it further made an impression with me because i used to spend time in teaneck several years ago so some of the characters were kept real at times this movie seemed like a documentary because you didnt know whether or not these were real events taking place although movies like boys in the hood and menace ii society grab more attention i personally feel these movies were somewhat enhanced to appeal to a broader audience new jersey drive was an uncompromising piece of in your face reality lee and gomez covered every detail in this urban drama from the music clothing slang and locationunlike some of the movies i mentioned earlier the actors performed as if they werent actors nothing was compromised in order to make good theater the only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people slept on it i look forward to more works of art from nick and spike in the hopefully near future,1,-1,neutral,
woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court okay that sounds all right there it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film this movie became redundant retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by woody harrelson played one of my favorite tv characters woody from cheers and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie but after seeing his acting performance i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend his acting was as dull and poor as the movie another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez i have liked movies with perez before but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didnt have that many speaking lines do the right thing but now in white men cant jump she was made a central character with many lines thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice so after seeing this film term used loosely and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that im a white man and im getting ready to jump off a twenty story apartment building,0,0,positive,

for some perverse reason best known to themselves these imdb boards seem reluctant to credit the great billy wilder as coscriptwriter on at least two this one and ninotchka of his early classics when any buff can detect the wilder hand at work as it happens this represented the first time he was teamed with charles brackett who does get a credit and it was a great start one commenter has noted how satisfying it is to see these type of films in oldfashioned cinemas and i couldnt agree more in paris one of the smaller revival houses shows in one of its salles a more or less continuous lubitsch retrospective and im pleased to report that this played to a very appreciative audience right across the age spectrum though i doubt whether any were actually alive when it was first released in 1938 the famous wilder schtick the meetcute is particularly tasty here when millionaire butcarefulwithit cooper attempts to buy half a set of pajamas in a department store on the riviera and meets with sales resistance until claudette colbert turns up and agrees to buy the other half the gag is milked even more when having exhausted the chain of command at the store itself the manager places a call to the owner who is in bed and leaves it to reveal that he too is only wearing the top half of pajamas the film is full of sightgags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect claudette colbert is only terrific and gets great backing from edward everett horton as her impoverished titled father david niven in fourth billing has some funny business as does franklin pangborn and if gary cooper is not up to his role lacking as he does the verbal dexterity and sophisticated persona that wilder scripts called for at this stage of his career well you cant have everything and what you do have is darned near perfect,1,1,positive,

charles chaplins shoulder arms of 1918 was his longest film to date though at just over 45 minutes in length it was not quite a feature film with world war one just drawing to a close many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops and chaplin was no exception and so the lovable tramp went to war the film begins with the tramp in training and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills including marching and gunslinging much to the disgust of his drill sergeant the tramp then finds himself in the trenches faced with a more formidable foe though the germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he the uproarious moment when the tramp declares that he singlehandedly captured thirteen german soldiers by surrounding them had me in stitchesthere are plenty of other great moments in this film chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surfacehowever the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree the reactions of the bumbling german soldiers unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy as they are singlehandedly disabled onebyone are highly amusing especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewoodthis is a very enjoyable film and one of the best of chaplins pre1920 efforts highly recommended,1,1,positive,

this movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama about two guys who worked in a butchers shop and wanted to build up their own when they finally fulfilled that dream they faced a new problem there were no clients one day by accident one guy dies in the refrigerator room and a new kind of butchers business begins they start selling human flesh saying to the clients its just chicken and their business starts to improve human flesh sells good oh i forgot to say something these guys arent normal theres really something missing in their brains the movie has some nice dark humour scenes but it is in my opinion mostly a drama one that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath what are his motivations to what he does i must confess i was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie because i never expected they could make it without been discovered but thats probably because i see too many hollywood movies what i mean by this is that in hollywoods cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the bad things theres always a morality protecting the good values in spite of we all know that in real life it doesnt happen this way too many times and i liked this movie mostly because of that because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true frontal without fake moralities and which see what is on the other side behind the conventional morality it just happens in independent cinema especially in the european besides therere excellent performances by nikolaj lie kass and mads mikkelsen especially the first one in the roles of the disturbed guys very nice danish film,1,-1,positive,

if it wasnt for the very attractive jennifer jostyn in the lead role i would have turned milo off after the first 30 minutes however as easy on the eyes as she is shes not enough to save this film not by a long shotmilo starts off with a group of young girls accompanying an assumed young boy in a yellow slicker to a house in the woods where he shows them embryos in jars apparently the deal was that if he showed them the jars ol milo gets to conduct a gynecologist exam on each in return one of the group volunteers to be milos first patient and he leads her behind closed doors moments later blood flows from under the door and we are whisked into present day enter the lovely jostyn who plays one of the girls all grown up in present day a substitute teacher with shallow confidence whose closest friend appears to be a goldfish she receives an invitation to return home for a friends wedding yep you guessed it return to miloville milo who allegedly drowned years ago seems to be having a dilemma staying dead and begins terrorizing and murdering the girls he failed to examine all those years agomilo the character reminded me of one of the mutants from cronenbergs the brood he could have been scary but just how scary can a villain be who wears a yellow raincoat the plot confuses even itself and the conclusion left me wanting my 90 minutes back im sending milo an inept slasher film to stand in the corner,0,-1,positive,
two things are always signs that youre going to be watching a bad movie 1 if youre instantly reminded of other movies like the terminator hardware or blade runner during the title sequence 2 if theres a death during a sex scene straight after the title sequencetheres actually a third warning sign and thats a caption indicating lazy exposition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed guess what cyborg 2 starts with a caption warning us of corporate greed in the future followed by a title sequence that reminded me of the terminator hardware and blade runner followed by a death during a sex scene hey you dont suppose ill be watching a bad movie by any chance as you can guess this is a bad movie its basically a series of action scenes written around a thread bare plot of a cyborg on the run from a greedy corporate company its badly written directed and acted and most especially its badly lit which means its very difficult to see whats happening on screen though im not entirely sure this is actually a bad thing the only interest to be had is that its the film debut of angelina jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic line theyre lovely i wonder if theyre real which is something i ask myself whenever i see one of her movies,0,0,positive,

there are a number of problems with this movie but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little the base story is quite good but the money just wasnt there to do the story justice the nonexistent budget really killed this movie stuart gordon the writerdirector has writing credit on honey i shrunk the kids which was a box office smash however that movie had some serious cash backing from disney honestly this is a good example of when to not make a movie had he waited a few more years technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects not to mention he could have found a company with money,0,-1,neutral,
sixth and last movie in the boxset well looks like ive saved the best one for last ghoulies iv i originally did a review for this back in like february but i decided to do a new one the ghoulies series is pretty awesome i know there are some people who dont like them and thats fine this happens to be my favorite one in the series yeah i know the actual ghoulies dont appear and are replaced by 2 guys in costumes one of them being tony cox from bad santa now onto the moviethe movie centers around jonathan graves the main character from the first movie being played once again by peter liapis who is now a cop for the lapd and has put his past of the occult behind him during the first part of the movie we encounter alexandra played by the very hot stacie randall communicating with a demon from beyond named faust who is the dark side of jonathan faust asks alexandra for a red jewel and something goes awry therefore unleashing the ghoulies from the beyondi think jim wynorski did a good job with the directing and the music by chuck cirino is funny as well spoiler ahead at the end of this movie the ghoulies say that there will be a ghoulies iv part 2 or ghoulies v i still hope that sequel gets made and i especially hope jim wynorski returns to direct i agree with gimbotheghoulies on that,1,0,positive,
this is a film that in no way reflects the real world nothing in this film makes any real world sense or has any real world logic it operates entirely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hate for this filmi love the filmsomewhere at the very beginning i bought into the completely unreal premise of the hit woman regaining her memory as the past comes back to haunt her there was a moment early on where i remember accepting that this was going to be one of those movies where the heroine was going to know nothing until it was needed despite all logic that it wouldnt happen that way oh its one of those films i said to myself and was hooked as the film took off on a wild two hour chasethis is an action film with brain and brawn as things follow there own internal logic and you actually have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns i like this a great deal and am pleasantly surprised when i bump into people who feel the same way too people either love it or hate it if theyve ever heard of it at allif you like action films this is a film to definitely try you may not like it but it certainly worth the effort to find outand as always leave reality at the door,1,1,positive,
goodbye mr chips is a superbly written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film aside from peter otooles wonderfully controlled understated performance as the pedantic schoolmaster who finds love and is changed by it the film contains hundreds of stunning visuals from grecian ruins to london side streets to an extended countryside montage the music and lyrics by leslie bricusse have been criticized as being dull or notupto par for film musicals but they are used to enhance the story rather than tell it many songs are used to underscore montages or scenes the few that dont are relegated to show biz numbers in this manner the songs do not intrude upon this delicate story but heighten what the characters are thinking or feeling where did my childhood go walk through the world with me and you and i are especially effective an absorbing brilliantly acted directed and written film,1,1,positive,

at first glance a film like northfork a town set to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople could be just an ordinary film as we soon meet a remaining priest taking care of a sick child a greedy land owner we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily digest however when one is first introduced to this film you notice the amazing wide open cinematography and a scene involving a church hall missing a wall that opens up to the pastures and scenic view of the mountains with cattle grazing it soon becomes clear that after this scene and a few of the towns peoples introduction that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story it is something very special and uniqueat first glance things are not as clear but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer is witness to is stunning and the characters that inhabit this small soon to be extinct area are just in word amazing its what can either draw you in closer to this qwerky film or either have you bored sitting there waiting for something to happenthe films deep spiritual and dream like qualities give it a slow and methodical approach which i am sure will bore some viewers but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture the film is great to witnessrating 8 out of 10,1,1,positive,

i hadnt planned on seeing this movie however i wasnt disappointed when a friend dragged me along although there are no real surprises here the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budgetif youve seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and theres a pretty constant stream of jokes here with a couple of classic moments with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980s also ive read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment but i found it refreshingly different from what i had expected from this genreoverall this movie wont change your life but its got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout,1,1,positive,
there arent many overcomingtheodds stories quite like that of christy brown born with cerebral palsy in 1930s dublin his parents thought his handicap was mental as well as physical though eventually properly diagnosed brown in a lower workingclass family with nearly 20 children had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family through the use of his only fullyfunctioning limb his left leg he taught himself to write and paint both skills he developed expertly but what makes the film version of browns autobiography my left foot such a great retelling is its humility both directorwriter jim sheridan and star daniel daylewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesnt scream for attention and resort to melodrama cheesy struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of minute victory are easy pitfalls of a story so miraculous yet my left foot stays real and intrinsically inspireddaylewis is the easiest to highlight playing anyone with such serious physical impairments has to be a demanding task not only does daylewis give us a very complete picture of christy but he also manages to chronicle the growth improvement and inner change of the character in different stages of his life he plays christy at 17 when he had limited language capability and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he does the intellectually learned christy who struggles to cope with why he cant find nonplatonic love the latter theme is the films strongest and it wouldve been nice for sheridan and coadapter shane connaughton to really flesh that out regardless daylewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all those elements giving a performance thats so believable you often dont have time to think wow hes such a great actor those are the most commendable performancesequally important but through more subtle means is sheridans work on the film this story is about daytoday life and struggles although christy has such a unique set of circumstances hampering his life his struggles are not unlike our own and sheridan grasps that concept completely christy struggles with love parental attention questions of self worth and capability his struggles are just more physically manifested literally and figuratively than ours sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the large brown family and christys unique place in it the drama evolves naturally when tensions are highest and the humor comes in much the same way the dinner scene when christy learns that his doctorteacher the woman he loves is going to marry his brother peter is the films finest example of both daylewis and sheridans efforts its built up to so well by sheridan that it comes out when were ready and daylewis takes us from there with his stunning workthe other strong component of the film is brenda fricker as mrs brown i did not know shed won the oscar but there was something about her performances as christys loving and wise mother that just screamed oscarworthy her love for christy and constant fighting for him just seems so convincing and heartfelt and she earns a lot of sympathy given her situationthe emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal perhaps that was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels organically human the two should be reconcilable but i imagine its challenging to tell a story that feels truetolife and one that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster the choice to downplay the latter was definitely the wise one for my left foot browns circumstances speak for themselves they dont need to be squeezed for weightier dramatic impactsteven cvisit my site moviemusereviewscom for more,1,1,positive,
some of the background details of this story are based very very loosely on real events of the era in which this was placed the story combines some of the details of the famous leopold and loeb case along with a bit of aimee semple mcphersonthe story begins with two mothers shelley winters and debbie reynolds being hounded as they leave a courtroom the crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm as their sons were just convicted of a heinous thrill crime one person in the crowd apparently slashes winters hand as they make their way to a waiting carsoon after they arrive home they begin getting threatening phone calls so reynolds suggests they both move to the west coast together and open a dance school the dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next shirley temple one of the parents of these spoiled kids is a multimillionaire who is quite smitten with reynolds and they begin dating life appears very good but when the threatening phone calls begin again winters responds by flipping outbehaving like shes nearing a psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religionlistening on the radio to sister alma almost constantly again and again you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things i wont say more as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting filmin many ways this film is a lot like the bette davis and joan crawford horror films of the 1960s like whatever happened to baby jane straightjacket and the nanny while none of these are exactly intellectual fare on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun the writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting winters is great as a fragile and demented lady and reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 yearolds ive ever seenplus she can really really dancemy only concern about all this is that some might find winters hyperreligiosity in the film a bit tackylike a cheap attack on christianity at first i felt that way but when you meet sister alma she seems sincere and is not mocked so i took winters religious zeal as just a sign of crazinesswhich i assume is all that was intendedby the way this film is packaged along with whoever slew auntie rooanother shelley winters horror film from 1971 both are great funand quite overthetop,1,-1,positive,
this was something i had been looking forward to seeing the ultimate avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since iron man has been one of my favorite marvel characters i thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an iron man solo title but the final film was unsatisfying i wasnt expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to iron man gray armor the red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together not a major complaint but not what i expected from the ads and box the worse thing however was the story the acting and the cellshaded cgi animation for the monsters and iron man armor that was not convincing it didnt blend in well with the cell animation at all even on its own it seem sticklike and lifeless tony starks character arc as incredibly slow as it takes is so forced and unconvincing i wanted to see this movie because i love iron man but after forcing myself through the film i wondered if they couldnt have come up with something that had been as good as the ultimate avengers movies,0,1,positive,
this is a lowbudget spoof of the espionage genre to help frame your expectations you should know that 1 the acting is wildly heavyhanded the stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement frequent hand gestures and offkey pacing 2 the script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements 3 shots are frequently framed in offbalance angles poking fun at genre excesses 4 a popeyed jeff goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic mannerthe film has a guiding intelligence deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the bfilms of the 1930s a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by carl sagan the films overthetop acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes in an early running gag fay grims son ned is so frequently told to leave that you cant help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad parker poseys nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the filmthe films slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge the films impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy moreover it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic the musical score is intentionally heavy handed and i found this and the offkilter camera angles more irritating than humorousthe overthetop acting the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiraciescounter conspiracies and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers the movie is much too long at 158 minutesthat said fans who are receptive to the films sarcasm might want to watch again using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog the film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavyhanded than lighthearted but the comedy may well appeal to your tastes the film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films fans of director hal harley or devotees of parker posey who has the most camera time,0,1,positive,
is a big struggle as a story that is surreal this movie couldve been great as great as it is rated by some here but mixed with the acting director and relatives playing major roles due to financial reasons i reckon found in here although calling this acting is not only a stretch of that word its giving it a new meaning a whole new meaning if you are into surreal movies there are some that i do like actually see the japanese strange circus for example you might be able to overlook the flaws see above and enjoy this more there are great ideas here after all many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes but while watching this with a group of friends almost all of us just couldnt stop laughing not the intention of the director of course again everyone has their own liking as one can see by the high rating of this movie but i could only recommend the movie if youre aware of the work that alejandro jodorowsky has done andor are a fan of his,0,1,positive,

cultdirector lucio fulci is probably most famous for his gory zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the godfather of gore fulcis absolute greatest film however dates back to 1972 and while it is definitely gritty and violent it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films non si sevizia un paperino aka dont torture a duckling of 1972 is not only by far fulcis greatest film this tantalizing and utterly brilliant giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre the stunning atmosphere and tantalizing suspense the great sizilian setting the intriguing story the brilliant performances or the intense moments of sheer shock i dont know what to praise most about this ingenious giallo dont torture a duckling truly delivers cinematic perfection in every aspect which makes it an absolute masterpiece of italian horror cinemacontrary to other gialli it is not seductive beauty queens who are slain one by one but little boys who fall victims to a killer on the loose bodies of little boys are found in rural sicily while the police are desperately searching for the killer the little town is basically full of strange people and the townsfolk are screaming for a culpritthe film is stunningly suspenseful and uncompromising from the very beginning with a gritty dark and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal the acting performances are among the best in italian horror cinema tomas milian one of my personal alltime favorite actors is excellent in the lead as journalist andrea martinelli who is investigating the crimes sexy barbara bouchet delivers both eyecandy and a brilliant performance equally outstanding performances come from irene papas and florinda bolkan who is utterly brilliant in her role the great score by riz ortolani brilliantly intensifies the suspense and atmosphere and the film is ingeniously shot in fascinating sicilian landscapes although not as gory as many other fulci films this film is definitely gritty and uncompromising in its violence with a few shockingly brutal scenesdont torture a duckling has everything brilliant horror requires this is not quite as easy to get hold of as most other fulci flicks but i assure that searching it will pay off any horror fan must see this personal favorite of mine and i highly recommend any true lover of film in general not to miss this a masterpiece,1,1,positive,

it has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better bargain bin movies out there id feel a bit cheated if i had paid 15 for it but at about 150 i felt that i definitely got more than my monies worth the film cant quite decide if it wants to be mad max or one of the clint eastwood man with no name spaghetti westerns and as such is stacked with clichs from both even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in mad max is therethat guy from blade runner also cops a good billing although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the moviefavourite bit for me the punchup on top of the oil refinery if you look closely you can see the postapocalyptic rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each otherget several lagers in a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel,1,0,negative,

well since its called porno holocaust and directed by joe damato i went into this film expecting sleazeand while i somewhat got it porno holocaust was a massive disappointment as its just so damned boring the title suggests that the film will feature porn and thats not wrong porno holocaust is pretty much just porn and most of it is just the same stuff over and over again i was fast forwarding before the end the first sex scene is between two women and it got my hopes up but after that it just degenerates into normal porn and the rest of the film for the first hour is made up of talking and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through the plot focuses on a deserted island where believe it or not something strange is going on naturally its not long before a group of people made up of a few men and some scientists who all happen to be sexy women land on the island they have sex a few times and some strange things happen then over an hour later theyre attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladiesthis must have seemed like a good idea for an original porno a zombie who likes to get it on but unsurprisingly it doesnt work well at all the film clocks in at just ten minutes short of the two hour mark and that is far too long for a film like this i have no idea why porno holocaust is as long as it is if theyd just snipped one minute out of every sex scene the film would have been under ninety minutes and that would have made it much more tolerable the zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear its quite a long time before theres a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place and when it does finally appear its a huge disappointment i realise that this is low budget bmovie trash but damato surely could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this im not even going to bother mentioning the acting atmosphere etc theres no point porno holocaust is basically just your average dull porn flick with a slight sprinkling of horror and i cant recommend it,0,0,negative,

heres how you do it believe in god and repent for your sins then things should turn around within the next day or so until the last fifteen minutes this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunks crappy life his mom dies his stepmoms a btch his dad dies he drinks he gets married he has kids he drinks some more his wife gets mad he disappoints his kids the wife threatens to leave he calls up a reverend late night bc he wants to kill himself then after the recap happens thats when we get the left behindlike subtle messagehe needed a paycheck this is the phrase i had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so i wouldnt lose my respect for madsenmadsen drops to his knees and begs christs forgiveness once he does he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way he tells his wife that hes found god and thats good enough for her flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church end the movie as madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with christ and without alcohol final moment he gives a little dismissive wave to the bar ie sin house and give a gay miamivice afterschool special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freezeframes see why i had to repeat the phrase he needed a paycheckman this movie is bad the bgrade 80s production values dont help much the script could have easily been a touched by an angel episode it could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials the acting is wooden and never believable even madsen of whom im a big fan and is the sole reason i sat through this makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesnt know his a from his elbow yet on camera 45 minutes into it i started to get discouraged this thing was like homework i just wanted to put it away and say that alright i saw half of it thats good enough but no if i sat through cheerleader ninjas i could sit throughout thisthe only reason im not giving this thing a 1 is for two points 1 i love madsen i know its not fair but its great seeing the opening title introducing michael madsen sue me 2 some of the dialogue is so bad that its classic ill stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them toothats about it to wrap it up this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds but hey look michael madsen see also tilt executive target my bosss daughter etc now ive gotta rewatch reservoir dogs and watch madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him see ya kidsthis stuffs gonna make me go blind but im gonna drink it anyway madsens first taste of cheap alcoholi dont understand everything seems so beautiful madsen walking outside after confessing to godim going downtown later and pick up a bible and im gonna get a haircut too madsen after converting at the dinner table because satan lives in your hair,0,-1,positive,
a lot of good things could have been done with this movie using essentially the same sets plot devices and storyline for example why not plant a seed of ericas capability before the murder of her lover why not develop erica and the cops relationship slowly and convincingly maybe contrast erics metamorphis by including some other postevent facet relationship etc in her life that she now rejects why not have her injure an innocent bystander to underscore the wrongness in ericas actionsinstead tbo exploits the revenge fantasy to its maximum level giving insincere lip service to the dont do this at home messages thrown in only to allow the film to qualify as legitimateim not a jodie foster fan after displaying some range in films like silence of the lambs nell and one where she plays the ordinary mother of a child prodigy foster has slipped into a succession of roles where she plays the same hardbitten badgered heroine singlehandedly overcoming evil such is fine once or twice but im getting too used to her fight versus flight closeup tbo could have used a younger actress or one that more convincingly embraced being a woman in her forties instead of 40something foster playing a younger womantbo is a movie with substantial actors financing and resources that manages to descend to junk,0,0,positive,

great voices lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie the addition of character to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning particularly the relationship between the older fellow shadow and the young hellraiser chance the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive which is done perfectly here sally field is lovable in anything but really shines in this film as the proud feline sassy great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent theres even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids hats off to disney,1,1,positive,

man with the gun is pretty much forgotten now but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when robert mitchum turned down both jett rink in giant which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked and charles laughtons intended version of the naked and the dead to make it instead despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both mitch and jan sterling in unflattering tones its a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier blood on the moon as his town tamer sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to possibly be almost as bad as the men he dispatches certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him doesnt inspire much confidence in his stability as well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast henry hull it also boasts a strikingly good early alex north score which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in spartacus,1,0,negative,

a number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak she was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released i think that the difference didnt matter for a suspense drama like vertigo but it does matter for a romantic comedy we can easily understand that is why his character would be attracted to hers but its less clear why hers would be attracted to hisstill the movie works as a light romantic fantasy the scene where she stares at him across the cats head with her dark paintedon eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring is true magic its a little jarring therefore when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building and we see the age difference very sharply as he embraces her she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee,1,-1,neutral,
havent seen this film havent even heard of this film it wouldnt surprise me one of the few truly independent films produced in the last ten years no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution the independent company kino films gave boesman and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion and the majority of major film critics didnt even bother reviewing it i guess a movie based on a one act one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in todays market and its the intelligent filmlovers lossfor the record both angela bassett and danny glover deserved ocsar nominations as did the cinematographer but the film received such little fanfare that i cant even blame the academy on that one this is a film that is challenging thoughtprovoking and heartbreaking and it actually requires the audience to meet it on its own terms taking that into consideration it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment director john berry wisely does not attempt to dressup athol fugards play sure were given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots but the film version of boesman and lena remains on the whole a story of two people living in inhumane conditionsstripped of their basic human rights boesman glover and lena bassett have no one left to attack but each other a third character joins them for awhile willie jonah amazing in a largely silent role but the films focus never strays from the title characters and what theyve become bassett and glover give brave performances as the broken couple performances that simply could not be improved upon vigorously and brutally stimulating both intellectually and emotionally boesman and lena deserves to be rediscovered of home video hands down the best film of the year 2000,1,1,positive,
when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar an arab potentate visiting washington dc his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state unknown to her however the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agendaa map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen in an area of barren desert known as the rub alkhali or empty quarter in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem sunnys new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet hera plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the films satirical content is rather toned down possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their countrys foreign policy this was after all the year in which ronald reagan carried fortynine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters if the film had been made a couple of years later in the wake of the irancontra affair its tone might have been differentthe film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm sunny is a typical goldie character pretty sweetnatured naive and not too bright there is however a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde actually that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed on the one hand sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from oregon on the other hand she is a 35yearold woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girlthe more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than hisher material and protocol is simply unfunny whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who apparently all lust after western women particularly if they are blonde and blueeyed there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mideighties as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley nastassia kinski film harem about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman and the miniseries of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting the filmmakers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latterday mr smith goes to washington sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizens duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blah but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedygoldie hawn has made a number of good comedies such as cactus flower overboard and housesitter but protocol is not one of them i have not seen all of her films but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst 310,0,0,positive,
this film released in 1951 has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50s the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians an officer determined to see that task through and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit this small band must hold on to a fort located close to the indian village until reinforcements arrive the indians know all to well that the small band is undermanned and could be wiped out before the help comes one major difference for this film only the valiant is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline but at the same time deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all even if they dont accept that chargegregory peck embodies the tightlipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory the troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort they in turn have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasnt taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause eventually the captain and the small band confront the hostiles and at the same time each confronts his own flaw the cast includes western stalwarts such as ward bond gig young neville brand lon chaney jr and warner anderson a sleeper of a film and a good solid western for fans of this genre,1,-1,neutral,

this film is truly a sorry excuse for film making the pacing is poor the budget must have been depressingly low and the acting is cutrate that is except for bela lugosi the audio at this point in time is also terrible with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie if these things bother you at all dont watch this filmif you can get past this however you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one a german plastic surgeon bela lugosi was hired by the japanese to operate on several japanese agents and turn them into the likenesses of upstanding american businessmen whom the japanese have kidnapped and killed after completing his work he was betrayed by the japanese and thrown into prison he later escapes and travels to america to seek revenge on his patients through a series of highlypublicized murdersit seemed as though bela lugosi was the only decent actor in the film and to be honest the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and stodgy the leading actress ended up being rather boring and stereotypical while the police officer assigned to her case was the common chauvinistic and always correct dominant male that is found in many films of this time period i also found that the camera work was completely uninspired often taking the exact same angles of the exact same rooms time and time again after a while this tends to drag the film down setting a very slow pace for the action which is more or less nonexistent anywayto me the idea is a fascinating one and with a better writer director script equipment and actors it could become an excellent film sadly these handicaps keep the film back for now and i cant recommend it to anyone but the most open of movie lovers,0,0,positive,
i saw most of the episodes of rmftm as a teenager on cliffhanger theater running after midnight on a local station some years ago and then again when mystery science theatre riffed on it in the early 90s time has not been kind to it i can certainly make allowances for the special effects which were quite impressive for a low budget 50s serial imo commando codys flying scenes were better than george reevessupermans in his tv show and i can also make allowances for the ahem acting and fight choreography except for the guy who plays the ruler of the moon men he is incredibly miscast he looks and acts like the fellow who comes to fix your plumbing not the despotic ruler of an alien race even the corny dialog works all right everyone rattles off their lines like strings of firecrackers with no wasted time or pauses for things like thought or introspection since everyone does this the viewer finds it immersive after awhile and even to my modern sensibilities it doesnt bother much what really irritates me is the writing and the plotting im not talking about the sunny weather on the moon or baking soda powered rocket ships or a flying suit that has controls labeled updown and fastslow im not even bothered by the cheesiness of the resolutions to the cliffhangers that end each chapter im talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no cumulative memory and by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train the plot goes through the same motions again and again dig it commando cody and his pal are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting earth or at least the usa against an insidious alien invasion but his office has no guards or security checkpoints they dont even have locks on the front doors so the bad guys walk right in and beat the crap out of the cody and his staff not once perhaps understandable but several times they even kidnap his female assistant on the second try and they never get any smarter to further prove my point allow me to point out the way that cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone he does this over and over and over cody also flies his ship to the moon the woman assistant comes along to cook stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back cody captures one of the atomic ray gunsand immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he couldnt be bothered to lock it up and so onand you would think that if codys efforts were so vital to saving the usa from the moon men that he might ask for a few soldiers with carbines a few helicopters and a tank or two to back him up instead of just working with the local police all the time this was supposed to be a military operation but they act like its another episode of gangbusters its all rather hard to stomach i appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraintsand i appreciate that cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre even though he loses half of his fistfights but i just cant help yelling door lock the doooor when the gangsters simply walk into his lab or try to blow up the ship and there are no security measures at the landing site in placenot even a fence still its ok of the three republic serials ive watched phantom creeps had a better plot and undersea kingdom had more atmosphere hah and a better hero than radar men but its an ok timewaster btwwhy radar men they didnt use radar they used atomic ray guns shouldnt the title have been atomic ray gun men from the moon,0,0,negative,
i came into this movie really wanting to line it i thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie dont get me wrong here i wasnt expecting citizen kane i was taking this for the b movie that it is that said it still fell short of the expectation the historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold the acting in the movie was very wooden all in all i give it 4 for a great idea but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals is it worth seeing i didnt wish for my two hours back but i dont know that id recommend it to others,0,1,positive,
this is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate it has good acting lots of gore and a decent plot one will be reminded of movies like the hills have eyes and pumpkinhead its obvious that the budget was not all that big but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors which seems to be lacking in a lot of todays big budget special effectsfilled films the film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work there are no wasted scenes so the films length is a bit short in addition it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel which would be very interesting as well so grab some popcorn turn down the lights and enjoy this one,1,1,positive,
i saw this movie in the early 1990s when it had been out on vhs for a little while at the time i found it to be interesting and was especially struck by the ken russell segment with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgerylast night at a 2ndrun showing of the latest indiana jones movie the vision of john hurt prompted an unexpected flashback to aria which i had not thought of in years and the sudden memory of the russell piece itself was enough to cause an outbreak of tears for a little bitif i can make this observation i note with interest the lovehate reaction that people have expressed to the russell segment and i have found this interesting difference in other movies that delve into deep trauma and its aftereffects some get it others do not interestingi see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways this is how it affected and affects me,1,-1,positive,
somebody called howard koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for casablanca didnt he or didnt he maybe theres more than one koch slinking around in hollywood and im not too fond of casablanca anyway wait a minute yes there is another howard koch slinking around hollwyood thats the one who wrote casablanca no matter ill put as much care into this comment as howard w koch put into this production which is to say only a littleyou know what this sounds like somebody read cliffs notes on shakespeares king lear and decided since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy endingthere are differences lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so asks them how much they love him two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear but in the play lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating kids can do that to you take my kid for instance after all the effort i squandered on raising him does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer no in the end everybody in the play diesin the movie evidently the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself somebody jumps in and saves her so the ending is more or less happy thats the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself,0,-1,positive,
creepshow 2 is little more than a pale imitation of the original designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film it even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor which was often predictable and heavyhanded still the first time around there were enough thrills to make up for its periodic lulls resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort the sequel has few worthwhile moments so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent once in a while it delivers but most of the time it just lingers thereas in the original all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts a wooden indian comes to life wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster a hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist none of these premises are inherently bad in themselves but they are utterly lacking in inspiration there are few surprises and no scares this a textbook example of unmotivated bythenumbers filmmaking it doesnt help that this cheaplooking movie suffers from a flat directorial style although to be honest there wasnt much to work with in the end the second story comes off best but not by much for the most part the performances are okay at best george kennedy as the illfated general store owner does an adequate if not particularly inspired job dorothy lamour on the other hand is quite good as the guiltridden motorist evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable redundant material however most of the characters are pretty thin overall one would think that creepshow 2 would have turned out better george romero who directed the original returned to pen the screenplay based on more of stephen kings stories makeup effects artist tom savini turns in some good gory work so why is the film a letdown i guess romero didnt really want to make a second film but was forced to do so for financial reasons it was a decade of horror sequels clones ripoffs and whatnot so this one was certainly inevitable i can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry picking up his paycheck and running off i guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects financed we cant blame himrating 12 out of released by new world pictures,0,0,positive,
i had recently been watching johnny test in an attempt to find humor in it i failed horribly cartoon network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences but johnny test is entertainment in its lowest form the writing is incredibly predictable and the running gags arent much gags at all kids will love it and thats about itnow this isnt to say that its all bad the original opening theme was actually pretty catchy but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat its a shame because that was really one of the best things it had going for itsome of the characters could be very interesting in theory with a little work the characters could work well together but theyre too onedimensional then again this makes it easy for the kids to follow the pace is a bit too fast as well the episodes are too busy leaving little time for clever writing this is a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth on the upside however the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest and thats really the entirety of the target audienceoverall the show looks very good on paper but just doesnt succeed in being funny or interesting this is a show i want to like but im incapable of it theres just so much potential that isnt realized kids will enjoy it but thats about it,0,0,positive,
hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of vienna it comes from former documentary director ulrich seidl who adopts a very documentarylike approach to the material however the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as extremes some are extremely lonely some extremely violent some extremely weird some extremely devious some extremely frustrated and misunderstood and so on the film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering viennese summer very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people the many ills that plague our society in general it is a thoughtprovoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the wholea fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wifes clothes a nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boyracer boyfriend a couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people an abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again a security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat and a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car the lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wavethe despair in the film is palpable many scenes are characterised by long awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and onscreen events leave you reeling in particular a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitchhiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy to be beaten raped and humiliated thankfully all offscreen for some vandalism she didnt even do arouses a sour almost angry taste in another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rearend and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife while we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his comeuppance we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment indeed such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film every moment of lightheartedness is counterbalanced with a moment of coldness every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair for every character you could like or feel sympathy for there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate we might want to turn away from hundstage to dismiss it as an exercise in misery but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded,1,-1,positive,
just after watching the first one and it is very dumb i happened to watch an episode of bones first and then the eleventh hour the 11th hour should be embarrassedit is so weak stewart introduces himself as a government scientist no mention of what kind of scientist just general sciency stuff in a program about cloning they bring a caretaker who was paid to dispose unsuccessful embryos to a church and made him kneel before the statue of jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness and as well tell them where the bad guy is so as they can move the plot on now thats science at work there is a dumb not good dumb bit where picard rages at a tv that advertises skin scream that makes you look younger shouting its a lie as his randy female assistant gets groped by the local hot bobbie next doorthe end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady named after pinnochios daddy in order to move the clunky plot along waves at picard from the street as she gets in a taxi picard is one floor up and he looks out a window wistfully going she got away he could like try to run down or maybe ring the cops or maybe get the number of the taxi and ring it in or maybe had anything other than i am waving and getting into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do about it until next week ending mahhahahahahpity its so stupid at one point a grieving father is convinced by picard that even if a replica clone son was born it would never be his son as his son had a soul yes thats right folks the general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that every soul is unique and sure why else would you want to clone although the general scientist picard finds cloning a bit gooey hes all up for stem cell research and goes as far as to say that calamity will befall humanity if it isnt allowed he has a pretty strident rant about how important it is of course he doesnt mention a single example that kind of sums up the show buzz words and tawdriness,0,0,negative,

as a 90 minute experience it is not up to the standard of drive as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the who am i academy while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark dacascos beat emup however those who enjoyed drive and i thought it was wonderful will undoubtedly enjoy this too you certainly wont rewind back to the start and watch it all again but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced even if not in hong kong and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets time and respect afforded to the likes of yuen wooping and corey yuen kuei if you sit through the first half hour and arent sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat bosch is magnificent and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics kicks and simple acts of bravery if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy then track it down and watch it its not shakespeare in fact its less articulate than coolio in china strike force but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team im pretty sure theres no safe way to land directly on your head or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car,1,1,positive,

october sky is a highly lauded movie and its easy to see why the story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper the hero finally gets what he wants and its a true story frankly i think the directors achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates we dont see any special narrative or cinematography the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters we feel homers desire to earn his fathers recognition and create his own future and his resilience wins our respect october sky reminds me of a later 2001 japanese production of mini series rocket boy which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison when october sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny rocket boy offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society starring the outstanding actor yuji oda rocket boy focuses on three men as ordinary as can be a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother like what homer feels in his family and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea the collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them impossible to compensate for his lost ideal kobayashi yuji works in the tour operator because its called galaxy when his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him he finally finds strength from his fathers words who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed but i dont regret it his father told kobayashi at least i tried it is his fathers confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair kobayashis effort finally fails and he goes back to the travel agency but his crazy courage inspires his friends and everyone loves him more just before the end of the series kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts after the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says astronauts wanted for 2004 kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs just like a kid looking at his ticket to disneyland kobayashi may never get what he wants but he dares his destiny and just does it this series is so heartgripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy unlike dilbert or other sarcastic writings this show enlightens us and teaches us something homer and kobayashi both have the dream and they do what they can despite other peoples opinions i recommend other imdb users to see the japanese tv series if you are a ninetofiver you will feel more touched i feel sorry that imdb doesnt have its data maybe you can ask somebody from japan to help you,1,1,positive,
in the tradition of gmen the house on 92nd street the street with no name now comes the fbi story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the federal bureau of investigation in the best possible light while its 48 year director j edgar hoover was alive it would be showed in no other kind of lightthe book by don whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from its founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film the fbi story came out its important sometimes to remember there was an fbi before j edgar hoover headed it some of that time is covered in the film as wellbut warner brothers was not making a documentary so to give the fbi flesh and blood the fictional character of john chip hardesty was created hardesty as played by james stewart is a career fbi man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twentiesin real life the bureau was headed by william j burns of the burns private detective agency it was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the harding administration when hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in he did just that through the hardesty family which is stewart and wife vera miles we see the history of the fbi unfold in addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the fbis story itself stewart and miles are most assuredly an all american couple we follow the fbi through some of the cases stewart is involved with arresting ku klux klan members a plot to murder oil rich indians bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties their involvement with apprehending nazi sympathizers in world war ii and against communist espionage in the cold warthere is a kind of prologue portion where stewart tells a class at the fbi academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own that involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight nick adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant todayof course if the fbi story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all american still the fbi does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative onethe fbi story is not one of jimmy stewarts best films but its the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me if the whole fbi were made up jimmy stewarts id feel a lot better about it theres also a good performance by murray hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with baby face nelsonvera miles didnt just marry stewart she in fact married the fbi as the film demonstrates its dated mostly but still has a good and interesting story to tell,1,-1,positive,

i saw this at the 2008 palm springs international film festival there are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commenters here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so i wont too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of woody allen and maybe a little of federico fellini in this films collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real singular plot a few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call the beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that bookends the film it took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the plainest and homeliest looking people in all of sweden to make the cast this is swedens official submission for best foreign language film for the 2007 academy awards its a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film last year swedens official submission was the very weak farvl falkenberg and the year before it was expensive looking but dull zozo so once again sweden will have no chance in picking up the oscar this film has its moments and would have made a good 2025 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film roy andersson directs gustav danielsson is the cinematographer editor anna mrta waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this benny andersson of abba fame provides an entertaining music score its an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and i did like it but its nothing really special and could only give it a 70 out of 10,1,1,positive,

i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success at least hed have wound up with somethingthe film struck me as pointless rambling and very stylish like some other recent french films not to knock it most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever we should be grateful i suppose for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a windblown continental winter and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand whats upbut there can be too much of a good thing golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood youll love it if youre vlad the impaler lots of people die catherine deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle i dont know why golubevas young girl dies too and i dont know why she dies either she gets slapped in the face falls to the pavement and diesthere is supposedly an explicit sex scene too ill have to take their word for it because although it is stylishly photographed it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness dont worry about the kiddies being shocked theyll probably be asleep by this time anywaydepardieu isnt a bad actor as we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man well handsome except that his nose cant seem to get out of his way to a limping murderous hairy physical wreck we feel sorry for the guy golubeva has a wan pretty face with enormous halflidded eyes and wide cheeks like a doll her next movie should be a remake of lewtons i walked with a zombie then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band i guess its a band as far as i could make out the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of easy listening might not enjoy it if you dont like the music theres a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with depardieus walking sticki must say i found it barely worth sitting through and its a longie too at times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by sometimes stopping entirely i wish it had had a few jokes,0,0,positive,

if this movie would have been in english all critics would have trashed it the language is extremely bad the scenes are awfully directed and its not at all funny after the movie i thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts oh on dogs as well the story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time of course the public chose jalla jalla while vingar av glas got little attentionwhat was really disturbing for me was the fact that the movie looked really bad that was probably due to the fact that first time director josef fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play around with it for fun i suppose the result however is a movie that can easily be split into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each one of them this was very frustrating maybe josef fares should have stayed with his short films since that seems to be the only art form he can masteranother disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together at several times in the middle of the movie the story has to move on very quickly and the characters then run into one another in a way that is just too unbelievable and then i have not mentioned the 2dimensional characters especially those in the supporting roles even though i consider this one of the worst swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated it is kind of understandable that the public liked it i mean bad taste has always been the trademark of the massesim more surprised that the critics enjoyed it they should have known bettergrade 2 of 10,0,0,positive,
disney the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years films like tarzan and the emperors new groove have made an attempt to move away from the traditional songdriven routine of disneys past and into new uncharted territory atlantis is the boldest step yet but we have to remember this is still disney the first ever serious film to come out of disneys animation studio is a major achievement for them in fact its so serious it makes it into pg territory perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summerbut despite the more mature subject matter this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with not just mature audiences so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of the little mermaid et also what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96minute movie ultimately this is an action film about atlantis not about the exposition preceding it so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly youre unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood if you want epic levels of detail in the plot turn to james camerons titanic both films feature a boat in some mannerand lets talk about love shall we yes as with a lot of films the lead male one milo thatch a bumbling archaeologist and lead female kida the clichd atlantian princess are set to fall in love with each other but what i found was not as clichd as i was expecting by films end for once the characters touchingfeelingkissing sequence was far more subdued theres various points in the film where the attraction grows but its just not in the ballpark of say the little mermaid a good thingyou may have grasped that this is a rather clichd film correct you have your leading hero and heroine backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition all being given their moments during the film numerous other characters appear take up the few minutes of screentime then disappear it doesnt take a genius to do the maths a 96minute film with a focus on action and visuals and with a considerable cast has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent so what does it rely on clichs and lots of them every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before you have the bumbling scientist the attractive princess the squarejawed colonel the rich eccentric the maniacal sleazebag the russian femme fatale need i go oni dont know why this got to anyone i found the tongueincheek nature of this film quite amusing alright this is meant to be a serious flick but do you really expect disney to give up every single trait of their history at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue and sometimes it even is a little inspiredbut in the end its those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake the cgi animation is truly amazing in places and doesnt dwarf the characters which was a flaw that let the recent titan ae down speaking of characters disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs bringing an anime style to the film infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime much more so than any previous disney outing this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime nadia for the films overall similarities with said cartoon series having not seen this anime i cant commentwith picture there is sound gary rydstrom heads up the sound team and what a soundtrack from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat james newton howard treats us to a dynamic musical score which compliments the film in every way never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue itperhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended to me the film conveys that its an adventure thrill ride albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it if you dont like the clichd tongueincheek attitude then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight heck at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts coughherculescoughthis is a positive 10 out of 10 review from someone who was blown away by this film i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film after all the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium so sit back enjoy the ride and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film,1,1,positive,
this is a great ending to the show the fact that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus infecting the queen with a poison that in essence ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and blanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today,1,1,positive,

imaginary heroes is a 2004 film starring sigourney weaver jeff daniels emile hirsch michelle williams and kip parduethe story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child pardue commits suicideordinary people has been mentioned often in relation to this film its sort of ordinary people with a role reversal the mother in this case sandy travis weaver is more accessible than the father ben daniels who is clearly devastated and unable to cope like ordinary people the younger son tim hirsch is the focus of the filmfor me the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it there were some wonderful interactions mother and son mother and neighbor brother and sister williams and some good offbeat moments what never clicked was ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with sandy this seems to have been the goal of directorwriter dan harris in one scene in a grocery store the checkout kid assumes sandy is about 30 and gives her his phone number in almost the next scene daniels asks sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday weaver was 55 when this film was made actually probably 54 and looks phenomenal so what is ben looking at however theres something askew about bens complete detachment because the viewer doesnt really see how daniels ever was attached to that familythe end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes everyone is very good with weaver and hirsch being the standoutstheres not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares the script could have been sharper but imaginary heroes is a good effort,1,1,positive,
cinderella was one of the first movies i ever saw and to me it is timeless it is a lovely looking film with gorgeous animation my favourite animation scene was the dress scene i just love those mice the songs are also lovely not as good as snow whites but they are a delight to sing and are reminiscent of tchaikovsky a dream is a wish and so this is love are standouts the characters are also a delight cinderella is idealistic and strong and the mice provided great comic relief the stepsisters were also well done as well as lucifer but i loved the stepmother the best she was really evil in comparison to a great character in the name of the fairy godmother it is true the movie drags slightly with the antics of the mice but they were genuinely funny so i dont care i dont think it is overrated underrated dont you mean it rarely plays on television but the really bad sequel does on cinemagic on a regular basis if you want a great cinderella adaptation try the wonderful ever after or the lavish slipper and the rose which isnt as good but whatever you do avoid the sequel which i have the mistake of owning because youll thank me 910 bethany cox,1,1,positive,

there have been many movies about people returning home from wars and having to cope but the war at home is worth seeing portraying vietnam vet jeremy collier emilio estevez having trouble connecting with his texas family much of the movie is very likely to tense you up but nothing can prepare you for what ends up getting revealedpart of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feeling of both texas and of the generation gap jeremys parents bob martin sheen and maurine kathy bates clearly have a problem with their sons attitude both about the war and his rejection of americanism his sister karen kimberly williams is uncertain with whom to side but after the dinner there can be no neutralityso we as americans may never be able to fully get over the vietnam war but this movie can probably help us look seriously at how it affected so many people emilio estevez certainly did a good job directing also starring corin nemec and carla gugino,1,-1,neutral,

i havent laughed this much in a long time or seen a film so ineptly made talk about so bad it made me laughfirstly i estimate that for about 40 percent of the films length i couldnt tell what was happening or indeed even what i was seeing i can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets lsd there are whole segments minutes long where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall people and various other unidentifiable stuff i spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening but they couldnt follow it any better than methen there are the black moments when in an effort to scare us woooooooo everyones lights go out and the screen turns pitch black and i dont just mean for a few seconds i think the longest lasted almost two minutes i guess blank film is one way to keep costs downi suspect the director had recently read a book on all the mustdos to make a scary movie and decided to throw them all in about 20 times eachthere are three good things about this film 1 its short at 90 minutes though still an hour and a half too long 2 all the characters die after all its impossible to care about any of them 3 there was one genuinely good scene when the group are looking up the shaft they came down after discovering their rope fallen to the bottom saw that coming a large boulder is pushed across the opening sealing them in i wasnt expecting that and it was genuinely chillingand whats with the early campfire scenes with the shot after shot after shot panning from behind the camp lights i swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutesand im positive that after the first kill the exact same footage of blood on the cave floor is used twice in about 90 secondsall in all a crap piece of film making ill watch almost anything but this is close to where id draw the line,0,0,negative,
first let me preface this post by saying that i am a fan of the original star wars moviesi dont read the books play the games wear the underwear or eat the cereal if there is one i am simply a fan of the filmswith that being said i struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise taking this movie by itself and not comparing it to its terrible predecessors ep 1 2 i dont understand how you can say this is an amazing movie for all of the terrible shortcomings in the script cheesy dialogue contrived scenes ie r2 suddenly being a badass and long cgi intense chase scenes that have little human touch horrible acting and noted plot holeshow is this good there was no real internal dilemma within anakin it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so which by the way was ruined by the noooooo frankenstein scene when you bombard the screen with intensely amazing cgi effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious oneliners when more could have and should have been said this is not a great movie for a film with such a dark tone there was too much levity in the speech of all charactersi close with a question from the beginning to the end of the film was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place,0,0,positive,
in my honest opinion everyone should see this movie at least once it really put things in perspective as i watched it though it was fictional this movie is about something that could happen to your childrenit shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school and their plans to murder innocent students this film would not have worked in any other format they pulled off the handheld camera perfectlyit reminds us of april 20th 1999 when eric harris and dylan klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves it also reminds us of the media storm that followed after everyone wanted to see the rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapesthis movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true we get to see the kid behind the monsterthe only bad thing about this movie is that it did not do well on the market and few people even know it existed if it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about zero dayi believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it the shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film because it mostly focuses on cal and andre and what they did up to that pointif you have not yet seen this movie go rent it and watch it i guarantee that when it is finished you will be speechless,1,0,positive,

heres my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the allencompassing con its like the grifters but without that films level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay crouses lines the way she reads them sound as if theyre inner monologue or narration which they arent with the arrival of mantegna things pick upthe dialogue here isnt as fun as it should be i was expecting crackerjack ringadingding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones dont it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words hes far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality whats more strange is that other than this the film doesnt look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with glengarry glen ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything flowedi wouldnt mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines or even play characters speaking play lines but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines its a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesnt work that doesnt mean the movie is bad it isnt its often extremely entertaining the best chunk is in the middleits standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is shes a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a compulsive gambler she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room ill admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting crouse to come in were they expecting shed write a cheque was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end howeverand from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones the little learner ones to be the most fun were getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is we see the ending coming and then we didnt see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didnt see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true callingim going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange linereading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it after the halfhour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch glengarry glen ross again james foley did him better,1,0,positive,
this film is so bad you cant imagine the acting is terrible even worse than in third class soap operas an it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 years in switzerland the interactions between the soldiers didnt make any sense at all the story could have been taken out from a bravo photostory the dialogues were as wooden as treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy but nowadays it doesnt need much to satisfy the audience the actors were handsome for example the former miss switzerland and the main character was even hung woah and there certainly was much abuse of drugs thats real cool man particularly for 12 and 13 year old teens but the media created an atmosphere in witch you was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the peer group dynamics by telling implicitly that you are a nerd if you dont go along with the other sheep and sayyes that is exactly what it was like when i was in the army thats exactly what im going to do when i must go to the army to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and coolness and dont think i like the army i was there and i hated it but this film is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a teeth brush which i was forced to do because i offended an lieutenant it is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and i think its not a bad thing but this kind of films influence teenagers to much by showing them a cool lifestyle which in fact is only stupid and turns them into brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots but since i now that my opinion isnt very popular i will be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any costs and for that to save your wits210sorry for my bad english,0,0,negative,

as much as i like walter matthau i felt that the majority of his roles were tailored towards his personality this role is one of the exceptions he plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest this role does require much more acting than in most of his other roles i liked the fact that the movie was honest about how a professional can be dishonest in order to avoid commitment in a relationship his whole aim was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman but not to be committed in any way the alibi using his secretary ingrid bergman to pretend to be his wife at some point in the movie the pretend mr and mrs actually are deluded into believing that they were actually really married the ending was good because a middle aged man found that pursuing someone in his own age group was more worthwhile the movie was funny entertaining and didnt sell out by being preachy,1,-1,neutral,

absolute beginners was a film for the younger generation a multitime film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled constantly hitting each note teens problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow it could have been dubbed the moulin rouge of the 80s but it disappeared it made its very shallow mark on the world snuck under the radar and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section the comedy section or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesnt need chain money to survive alas that wasnt where i found it but i found it watched it tried my hardest to sing along with it stared into bowies eyes but found myself faded by the end did it not survive the test of time is 1950s london too far removed from our current society is bowie too creepy i think absolute beginners falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang but withers to a mere sparkle by the endabsolute beginners opens with a huge number that takes us through the nongritty streets of london which involve theft nightly prostitutes on every corner dance throughout booze like rivers and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual sounds like a place we would all hate to be right director julien temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters the one we follow most is colin played by eddie oconnell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl suzette played by patsy kensit these two have chemistry and while suzette looks like a prerehab lohan to me they worked there was a huge spark between them the chemistry was like lava and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had never traveled i was ready but then something happened temple takes us out of the nightlife takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first suzette runs away colin becomes a pervert and bowie well i am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain i can tell you that much temple gives us this flashy city this opportunity to see those that inhabit it but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger we learn about colin mainly but nobody else i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom and what importance fashion had to that era also were they teens really they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s but maybe it was my tvcharacter development thrown right out the door temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example temple uses a split house to show us the lives of colins parents of which i didnt know it was them until after the film and a song which screams apathy great song too many characters not enough time suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency and it just falls apart in your hands then if that wasnt enough we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs rubbing our noggin trying to understand where our characters are or are going and temple throws in hatred anger and politics into the final act while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme i didnt think racism would be on the top of the bill suddenly friends are missing people are angry and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race somebody help me out here it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off to me the ending of absolute beginners was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number that first part set the pace and temple could not keep upoverall i must say that temple can direct a music video but i dont think he was quite prepared for the feature film i dont think this film will ever make it into full cult status and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come it is a fun film to watch initially but when we get to that final part it just explodes from the inside i wanted some cutting edge work but instead what i found was a freaky bowie coupled with characters i cared nothing for i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s but by the end it just felt forced i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to motivation by the everfreaky bowie in this film it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status i am glad that i watched this film once but that is all that my small brain can take i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning but he couldnt control his characters way too many and the songs didnt seem to match the final moments of the film it came out of nowhere and it was unwelcomed if this was a film about racism it needed to be from the beginning absolute beginners was a welcomed adventure but i dont think i will be dusting this film off in the futuregrade out of,0,1,positive,

this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kongs new wave that began with tsui harks zu warriors of magic mountain tsui set a tone for the new waves approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave jackie chan sammo hung wong jing ching siu tung etc accepted from then on as a given namely the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy burning paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeanceits not that there isnt humor here but it is a purely human humor as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw but this is just as humans are not even buddhist priests can be saints all the timewhen irony is at last introduced into the film it is the nastiest possible emanating from the abbot of red lotus temple who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before he is the very incarnation of miltons satan from paradise lost better to rule in hell than serve in heaven and if he cant get to satans hell soon enough hell turn the world around him into a living hell he can rulethats the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here its not that the abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism as allencompassing reality thus theres a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself it has become all there is to the universe and the abbot claiming mastery of infinite power is in chargeof course fortunately the film doesnt end there though there are losses the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails if you want to know how see the film yet there is no doubt that in viewing this film we visit hell hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience and somehow better for it over all,1,-1,neutral,
this extremelylowbudget movie is compared to the great classic silent night deadly night since it is labeled as a slasher flick first let me say that i think that even silent night part 2 is better than this that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie christmas evil tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insanea strong word slowly very slowly he is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of christmas and at work he cant stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love dressed up as santa he finally goes on a killing spree also a strong word since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects no tension no thrills no gore no cast for one exception that is jeffrey demunn is in it he is best known for playing aside tom hanks as one of the guards in the classic the green mile he still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role he truly is the only one who really can act his supporting role is better than the main lead who also isnt that bad but if youre overshadowed by a little supporting character youre not great either and what about that strange ending you have to see it to believe it christmas evil is downright boring nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading this is not a slasher you wanna see a real christmas slasher check out the all time greatest silent night deadly night,0,0,positive,
i have no idea why they made this version of persuasion when they already had that fine miniseries with amanda root and ciaran hinds i suppose that they wanted to make a featurelength version but of course a lot had to be deleted alas what ended up on the cuttingroom floor was all the lovely wit and humour leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of english country manners and moresalso the characters were shallow and uninteresting they had poor anne chasing up and down the streets after captain wentworth like a silly modern adolescent and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this let me tell you running after a male like a female in heat is not cool that is something a wellbred woman of the napoleonic era would never have done and certainly not this levelheaded heroinesome have said they found this antic laughable my reaction was not laughter but outrage the very idea of such a corruption of an austen work is beneath contemptit was ghastly,0,0,positive,

for some reason this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods despite owning the tcm uk cable channel which broadcasts scores of mgm titles week in week out more disappointingly its still mia on dvd even from warners recentlyannounced western classics collection box set which does include 3 other robert taylor genre efforts maybe theyre saving it for an eventual signature collection devoted to this stalwart of mgm which may be coming next year in time for the 40th anniversary of his passing i say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish westerner with a fanatical hatred of indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from 60000000 to 3000 in the space of just 30 years as an associate taylor picks on former professional of the trade stewart granger who rallies alcoholic peglegged lloyd nolan who continually taunts the irascible and vindictive taylor and teenage halfbreed russ tamblyn to this end as expected the companys relationship is a shaky one reminiscent of that at the centre of anthony manns the naked spur 1953 another bleak openair mgm western the film in fact ably approximates the flavor and toughness of manns work in this field despite being writerdirector brooks first of just a handful of such outings but which cumulatively exhibited a remarkable diversity here too the narrative throws in a female presence debra paget also a halfbreed to be contended between the two rugged leads and granger like the james stewart of the naked spur returns to his job only grudgingly his remorse at having to kill buffaloes for mere sport and profit is effectively realizedthe latter also suffers in seeing taylor take paget for himself she bravely but coldly endures his approaches while secretly craving for granger and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk taylor himself doesnt come out unscathed from the deal like the protagonist of the treasure of the sierra madre 1948 he becomes diffident and jealous of his associates especially with respect to a rare and therefore precious hide of a white buffalo theyve caught he even goes buffalocrazy at one point as nolan had predicted becoming deluded into taking the rumble of thunder for the hooves of an approaching mass of the species the hunting scenes themselves are impressive buffaloes stampeding tumbling to the ground when hit the endless lineup of the days catch and the carcasses which subsequently infest the meadows the films atypical but memorable denouement then is justly famous with winter in full swing a nowparanoid taylor out for grangers blood lies in wait outside a cave in which the latter and paget have taken refuge to shoot him when granger emerges the next morning he discovers taylor in a hunched position frozen to death incidentally my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this by milton lott from the time of the films original release actually he has collected a vast number of such editions it is after all a practice still in vogue where a book is reissued to promote its cinematic adaptation likewise for the record taylor and granger who work very well off each other here had already been teamed as sibling whale hunters in the seafaring adventure all the brothers were valiant 1953 which curiously enough is just as difficult to see in fact even more so considering that its not even been shown on italian tv for what seems like ages,1,0,negative,

having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its squandered potential when i heard that it was becoming a tv series i flatly refused to watch it my best friend became a rabid fan immediately and knowing my love for horror movies could not believe that i wouldnt watch a single episode i told him that the movie had scarred me for life as far as anything buffy was concerned and he told me to forget that the movie even existed he insisted that i give two episodes a shot once more with feeling and this oneboth of them are why i am a buffy fan today he was right i was hooked immediately i have never seen a show with the guts to dare try an episode that has next to no dialogue and nothing else couldve pulled it off with the panache and the pure creativity of buffy i think x files mightve gotten away with it if theyd thought of it first but im glad that buffy did it instead it is a credit to everyone involved that you are riveted for the entire hour sometimes hanging onto the edge of your seat and when it was all over i craved to know more about every character so i went out and bought the season one boxed set and the rest is historyi guarantee you that if youve never seen it either youll want to see more if you make this episode your first the only reason im not giving it 10 out of 10 is because im reserving that score for once more,1,-1,positive,
while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end i wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5 i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on even my add couldnt keep up it felt like a slight acid trip everything looked flat there was no dimension to anything there were so many shapes lines and patterns i really wanted to stop the movie midway and smash my burned copy of this movie but after i finish watching it i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watchingthe secret of kells is loosely based on the true story about the original book of kells a small boy brendan is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written this book will contain information that will help change darkness into light brendan lives in the village of kells behind huge stone walls taking place in the 8th century brendans uncle the abbot of kells is trying to build the wall to keep the vikings out brendans uncle insist he help complete the wall but a traveler and keeper of the book secretly trains brendan to hone in on his illustration skills and convinces him to complete the book and carry out its wordthe entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didnt really understand what was going on i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history a simple google search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of kells after reading many articles my opinion of the movie greatly changedthe book of kells is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament transcribed into latin by gaelic monks in ireland in the 8th century along with its paleographic and insular script the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art a type of early art form know for its intricacy complexity and miniature illustrations much of the art in the book of kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective but what makes the book of kells stand out from other early pieces of art is its use of many colorsthe secret of kells is very colorful i originally thought the animation was flat and boring it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and amine look to it once i learned about the art styles of the book of kells its obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie there are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit brendans mind whenever he goes into his imagination circular shapes resembling the sun cogs clocks and wheels begin filling the screen the edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles transitions are filled with color and celtic knots from the trees to the floors many things in this world are covered in shapes or patternsclocking in at 70 minutes minus credits the secret of kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people maybe just children interested i think one has to generally be openmined to the secret of kells as half art piece half movie about history despite looking like it was animated with adobe illustrator its a very nice looking movie but based on the 20 films submitted for oscar consideration i dont think it was worth being nominated over mary and maxthatwasjunkblogspotcom,1,-1,positive,
previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the films plot details than i could what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense emotionally visually editorially just gorgeousif you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of arton a scale of 1 to 10 id give it about an 875 the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece if you are in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then its a 10 i definitely think its a mustsee but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall 875,1,1,positive,

i saw this film at the toronto international film festival not as salacious as it sounds this is a threepart documentary each episode is 50 minutes featuring slovenian superstar philosopherpsychoanalyst slavoj zizek zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality fantasy morality and mortality it was directed by sophie fiennes of the multitalented fiennes clan shes sister to actors ralph and josephi enjoyed this quite a bit although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested freudian and lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours it didnt help that an illadvised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or somy only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with freudian themes he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch not exactly masters of subtlety i would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films although thats really just me saying id like to see part four and five and sixzizek is very funny and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films hes discussing so for instance we see him in a motorboat on his way to bodega bay from hitchcocks the birds or sitting in the basement of the bates motel from psycho which is not to say that his theories are not provocative even when i found myself disagreeing with him it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films which is exactly what hes trying to accomplish,1,-1,positive,

what the bleep do we know was one of the worst times i have spent at the movies it was less of a movie and more of an after school special but at the same time nothing special at all the attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic which almost anyone will tell you marlee matlin in her underwear just shouldnt happen i wont dwell on it what i will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate this movie while tedious also suffered a tremendous flaw in reasoning it was horribly contradictory because it took such a manipulative become a creator of your life manifestation of abundance shoeless piece of propaganda interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence however the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds it completely neglects that there are other people with minds that could be controlling us which seems to be more the case or at least the structures in which we exist greatly limit us in this way the movie was inappropriately solipsistic solipsism and interconnectivity just dont mix unless youre god almighty if you are you will be impressed by all the neat things this movie will reveal that you can do if not you will be sorely disappointed a moron or perhaps both also the title is so ridiculous i have trouble warning people not to see the movie because i feel retarded mentioning it by name shame on everyone involved,0,-1,positive,

what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed 16mm stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to revisit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an 88 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70s 80s but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the then illegal stag loop,0,0,positive,
this was the biggest disappointment of a movie sucks cos i was really looking forward to itall the twists were crap they were all flashbacks what makes a good heist movie is the believability of the the job yes it has to be surprising so the audience is stunned but if you walk away and go thats bullst whats the point plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway you didnt get to see the team operating at its full deceptive and brilliant potential there was not even one good heist in this movie they were all rubbish including that french idiots break dancing crap to get through the lasers its easy to do that when they are composited in afterwards plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie and it was stupid then as wellalso theres no reason to have even half of the 12 or 11 in this movie what difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie half the scenes dont even need to be there the first one was classy this was cheap and it makes the whole team loose credibility especially ocean himself for bowing down the bennett,0,1,positive,

very suspenseful surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students flatlining themselves and then being resuscitated to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond joel schumacher directs with some skill creating some very eerie scenes as well as particularly beautiful ones the visions of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which awaits us all when we go thanks to screenwriter peter filardi who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story while the creativity of the story is impressive the story has many holes as well particularly in the logic department and believability factors notwithstanding all of that flatliners is a good effective film because of the script the direction which again is very surreal at times and the acting which brings four very talented actors and william baldwin together this core of actors acts and reacts off each other very nicely keifer sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group the one who comes up with the idea to die and be born again he also manages to portray a man a young man with a damaging destructive secret from his past kevin bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group oliver platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears platt has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well yes julia roberts is here too and very good the actors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends i was duly impressed with much of flatliners but more than anything else the story affected me the most the scene with that dog hobbling around the street just one of those powerful images evoked as were many of the flashback scenes,1,1,positive,

if there is such a thing as beautiful horror this film is one of the best in this genre it is a horror movie which despite not being void of gore scenes relies more on psychology and masterful building of the tension in order to create thrills and it is one of those movies so beautifully filmed where each scene is a full world of symbols and details all serving the scope and genre that it can be called but beautifulit is not an easy story with two sisters returning to their father and stepmother mansion after having spent some time in a psychiatric institution they cope hardly with the death of their mother and they try to protect a world of theirs defending them against the adult world so the film seems to be at its most external layer actually the film slowly evolves to something very different at slow pace but no frame is lost to convey the sense of thrilling beauty so i will not say much more watch it it is one of the best in the genre of far east horror films that conquered recently the world cinema and it really shows that they succeeded to do it for good reasons,1,-1,positive,

paul armstrong is a liberal scottishborn professor of law at harvard known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver an eleven year old white girl earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row hoping to persuade him to confess to joanies murder thereby saving earl from the electric chair at first all goes well sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer warning major plot twist ahead and so it proves the anticipated twist soon materialises earl it transpires is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted and probably of several others as well but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom sullivan will confess to joanies murder if earl will murder his parents just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved earl has a grudge against armstrongs wife herself a lawyer who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape just cause is an example of the autocannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others the first half owes an obvious debt to films like intruder in the dust and to kill a mockingbird about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black whereas in earlier films he would have been white police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costagavrass music box although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end the finale in which a lawyer his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of cape fear which also take place in the swamplands of the american south ed harris characterisation of sullivan as a biblequoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niros character in the scorsese version of cape fear made four years before just cause there is a postscript just as just cause borrowed heavily from several other movies seven years later its central plot twist was in its turn to be blatantly plagiarised in the ashley judd vehicle high crimes the trouble with this style of filmmakingbynumbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts and just cause is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max cady blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the supposedly innocent young man of the early scenes but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better but neither is good enough to save the film connery and harris were to act together in another better film the rock the following year there is another problem with just cause the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal issue movie antideath penalty antiracist and critical of heavyhanded policing the second half looks more like the work of a diehard reactionary preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the presumably unwanted effect of reversing its political stance or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency 410,0,-1,neutral,
rossini once described rival composer wagners work as having some wonderful momentsand some awful quarterhours inuyasha it seems can also be described this way it has many great episodes but in between them are countless filler episodes the entire series consists of about 175 episodes of which id say at least 125 are filler or some sort of subplot i didnt bother to count and i wouldnt be surprised if that number were in fact higher thoughsome of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable though many are quite silly or dull nonetheless the constant digressions start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing at a labored crawl for most of the series character development too slows down greatly and by the later seasons the cast has become quite unchanging resulting in increasingly stale jokes particularly those concerning the monk whos ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedlyhowever all of that isnt to say that inuyasha is a bad series it just isnt a great series the way neon genesis evangelion for example is generally considered to be as something to watch at the end of a hard day it is nice but it could never be confused with high art,0,-1,positive,
this movie has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and executions those are the stress also given to the drama endured by victims parents without for that reason disguising the hatred and desire of revenge they feel or lessening the horror that execution represents and the christian vision of all the questions implied we must also point out that in this movie the sentenced man is not the usual nice innocent person we see in other movies dealing with executions which doesnt lead us to abandon the idea that a penal execution is no more than a legal murder anyway last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the convicteds last words and the detail with which the act of the execution itself is viewed in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to stress that we are being confronted with another murder so pitiless as the latter but performed in a cold and supposed legal way,1,-1,neutral,

the 80s is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun sometimes there were some definite brains behind it all evil dead ii night of the creeps and return of the living dead for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends movies like pieces and blood diner stacked rental shelves in the 80s and 90s offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment kevin tenneys 1988 movie night of the demons is a part of this traditionstupid poorly acted and not an original bone in its body but dammit if you dont have a good timethe plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80s a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20s decide to go to a party at hull house thrown by angela mimi kinkade and suzanne scream queen legend linnea quigley well angela and co decide to throw a sance this turns out to be as will arnetts arrested development character gob would call it a huge mistake because a demonic force soon possesses angela and starts to get to the others as welltake the evil dead a nightmare on elm street and your average dumb dead teen flick throw them in a blender and night of the demons is what you get the movie is anything but original and really its not a good movie the whole thing is insanely derivative the acting is terrible the jokes often fall flat the characters are annoying especially the character of stooge and the plot holes are numerous that out of the way its still a lot of fun so why well for one thing the make up and gore effects are top notch with some really memorable moments especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick that really stick out it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously yet with the exception of some terrible puns plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness plus theres a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise thats almost impossible to resist yeah its nothing special but it knows that and it couldnt be more proud of that fact its a goofy party horror movie and it never pretends to be anything moreit might not be a classic but night of the demons is a good example of horror junk food done right it might not be too memorable or original but sometimes you dont want a fancy beer sometimes you want a budweiser,1,0,positive,
let me begin with a personal note as a film and television buff more on the enjoyment side of life i love what james woods can do and has done and i always love melanie griffith and natasha wagner was very good in this awful miserable stinking true crime essaywhoever really wrote this film apparently never spent any time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents yes some thieves are junkies but they have very short careers as thieves truly successful thieves are seldom caught because they dont do junk or any drugs before going on a score job the james woods character was true to this paradigm in the beginning of this film and then the script fell apart completely he turns into a raging alcoholic lunatic nice work for a highstrung guy like woods maybe but not in the least bit believablemost criminals are lazy if they wanted to work they would workthese people in this film are beautiful selfindulgent drugaddled narcissistic losers they couldnt pull off a real score in the real world the real world where a big and beefy security guard who beats the living hell out of a skinny kid as happens in the early scenes of this dog keeps him beat down and doesnt let him up everhow many ways did i find to hate this film many even totally vulgar people like most sneak thieves and junkies have a larger vocabulary than these cretins and the ripoff scenes with the neonazi bikers puhlease all rednecks aint neonazis and those who are neonazi speed dealers just aint that dumb this film earned a two because natasha wagner was extremely good in her role as rose and because melanie griffith still has that something special or at least she had it for this brutal and offensively stupid film im not one to sing praises of real criminals for any reason but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that theyd all be dead or in jail by act 2 scene 1 watching a lousy zombie movie would be time better spent than this thing and i hate zombies,0,0,positive,

what can i say about the series dubbed the new outer limitshmm only that this was one of the best tv series ever assembled you have actors of all ages the actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot everyone playing their part to exact perfection these shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time if not all the time is very true you can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly not only do these shows have great story lines they also throw you into them get your mind racing and your blood pumping the original outer limits was a black and white in the 60s right these shows made a triumphant comeback the likes of which i have never seen the new twilight zone with forest whitaker was fun to watch but the new outer limits is where its at if you have not seen i implore you to please check these episodes out and you will see exactly what i mean long live the new outer limits,1,1,positive,

i had some expectation for the movie since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif well i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom 2 but if dhoom 2 is compared to tashan i would say dhoom 2 is very realistic when i saw the credits at the beginning i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way well the very first scene itself pised me off then the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights it was like akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns phewyou got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences arethe other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story it reminded me of some of the early 80s movieswell the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena who looked really hot in this oneand for that i give a rating of 2 out of 10guys pleasepleasedont see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie well you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenesthats all,0,0,negative,

every review i have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays the scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken so listen again and note the difference the play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received polite well enunciated english i am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in leicester unknowingly asked me age 14 to read a piece of walter scott which was written in the tone of the border i come from the border and when i read it as it should be read it made all the difference,1,-1,neutral,
i occasionally see some of this show because my wife watches it sometimes i try to enjoy it for its basic idea which is helping a needy family but several factors get in the way for me every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted which they are and tears flow seemingly on cue the attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional breakdowns and sad music is a real turn off for me the fact that everyone who donates something to the house be it sears or whoever has to plug themselves for being generous is also annoying probably the biggest problem i have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family now i know that this amount of money is nothing but a drop in the bucket for disneyabc but how much more could be done for more people with the amount they are putting on one house instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights isnt life difficult enough for the average person why do i need help finding things to feel sad about why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative i know what is being done for these families is good but they are also being used for ratings you cant tell me they arent being coached sometimes on the crying i guess when i see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the us could not afford for their children it really bothers me i cant help but think of what could really be done with a small portion of disneys money instead of giving each member of the family a flat screen tv and or personal shower that tells you the water temperature and shoots out of the ceiling why not help more people afford food clothes education and medical insurance i know so we can be entertained and have a good cry in terms of money i feel the same about oprah i dont think anyone can actually conceive the amount of money she possesses yes her recent reality show did good things but when she gave 30000 to each losing contestant im sitting here thinkingthats a years salary for many many peopleif theyre lucky dont get me started on game shows so i realize that extreme makeover home edition is doing good but forgive me if i see it as more self serving than giving of itself is there anyone out there that feels similar,0,1,positive,
people comparing this movie to big blockbusters like lord of the rings or the matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here the acting talent although not alist is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an alist cast my particular favourite from this movie is bridget fonda whose performance as the snow queen herself was quite moving assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup she injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devils evil magic fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from hollywood which i think is a good thing since hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and reliant on cgi and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger,1,1,positive,

question what do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in sand answer a good start well i dont know peter mattei from adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests love in the time of money is a good start a classy shoot with whimsical music box style music this flick looks at a chain of tenuous relationships as it moves from person a to person b to person cetcand back again ending with persons a b in carousel fashion the film gently probes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shadings beginning and ending with a street whore and her client the downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical slams it received i watched the behemoth angels in america last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies kept me spell bound use caution i may be the only person who really liked this flick b,1,-1,positive,

i usually much prefer french movies over american ones with explosions and car chases but this movie was very disappointing there is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens this french couple has been living in lisbon for years and they return to paris for a friends wedding they announce to another friend they are having dinner with that they are going to split then nothing much happens they dont seem to know whether they want to separate or not i dont necessarily think that their hesitations make for a bad movie it is very human to hesitate before making such a decision for good but this could be treated in an interesting manner giving some flesh to their desires and their relationship but that does not happen one gets out of the theater unsure of why these two got together or want to split the only piece i enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk that was true to life,0,0,positive,
ive often heard people express disappointment that mazurskys tempest has little to do with shakespeares original in my opinion that is both true and false but most of all its a bad starting point for offering critique a work of art should never be criticised for what it isnt but for what it is the movie tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to shakespeares work in spirit what tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time no not experimental as in hand held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings mazurskys tempest is epic sad realistic joyous full of life but most of all it is imaginative cassavetes portrayal of philipprospero is in itself worth a 1010 rating and when you add gena rowlands susan sarandon a wonderfully deep molly ringwald raul julia the dialogue the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture i rest my case one of the best movies of the 80s dont miss it,1,-1,positive,

in cold blood is masterfully directed and adapted by richard brooks however its also so bent on being realistic its sometimes more clinical than entertaining recounting the brutal killing of a midwest family author truman capote focused on minutia wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject and subjects brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama although he films on actual locations he keeps his distance the murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles which surely they were theyre not seen as misunderstood souls as in the capote book and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter the capote character the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall,1,1,positive,
this is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while its not funny at all it simply portrays a lower class northern british setting i find it a very sad film at parts at others cuts are where they shouldnt be one thing that really annoyed me was the close ups of pointless objects it really slowed down the pace of the movie i only made it through the movie because i fast forwarded certain sequences towards the endthis movie completely loses the attention of the audience its main problem is that it makes multiple reasons for one action which in turn tends to weaken that action however if there is one reason for one action it makes it more passionate all in all this movie is all over the place i didnt learn enough about the characters to care about them because of the shifting plot lines and stories where as i would have maybe enjoyed exploring the life of one characterfor example at the beginning when the guy meets god in the bar god seems like a cool guy the movie couldve elaborated on that moment and i think it wouldve been a lot funnieranyway enough ifs watch it if you want but im warning you this film is crap i respect the makers for trying to pull it off with such a low budget but they couldve done a much better job i guess it all lies in the camera movement and editing the acting was decent but then again thats just my opinion,0,0,positive,
not having heard of this film it came as a surprise when it was shown on cable recently gary ellis the gifted director of tough luck does wonders with the screen play written by bill boatman and todd king the film involves the viewer from the startarchie the young hustler at the center of this story has been involved in all kinds of petty crime in fact we witness a confrontation right at the beginning which makes him get out of new orleans as fast as he can he ends up in the carnival that is run by the mysterious ike archie falls for davina the woman he should have been wise to stay away from the result proves a fatal judgment for archie who then becomes the object of double crossing all aroundthe director should be commended by the casting of norman reedus who obviously is loved by the camera in spite of his nature one feels for him because we know his heart is in the right place the beautiful dagmara dominczyk is perfect as the exotic dancer divana who in spite of being ikes lover entices archie into falling heads over heels with her armand assante is barely understandable with the thick accent he speaks during the first half of the filmtough luck shows a new director gary ellis showing he will go to do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing,1,-1,positive,
boogie nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90s and id go so far as to say it should be in the imdb top 250 i can actually understand why many would dislike it due to the subject matter i personally feel however as many do judging from the aclaim this films received by viewers and critics that its topnotch film makingthe direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliancethere is not one scene in this movie that isnt amazing the individual characters reach out and touch you given that this is a movie about the porn industry one wouldnt imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are the direction is among the best ive ever seenand ive seen a lot of filmsthe film isnt about one particular personal individuals story its about manyits a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them boogie nights draws you into their story from the beginning and though the film is longi believe almost 3 hours you honestly dont even notice and when it ends you kind of dont want it toim not easy to impress meaning there arent many movies id give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one beyond the multiple character study is the use of music in the film i have never in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this moviethere was such flawlessness to it you know its not something your gonna see everydayburt reynolds performance was perhaps the best ive ever seen him do and mark wahlberg is incredibleim astounded there are still people saying he doesnt act well i dont know how anyone viewing this could possibly think thatbut the person who really surprised me was heather grahemrollergirl who is absolutely fantastic in her role in particular the one memorable scene with burt reynolds in the limo towards the endagain ill echo other imdb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody but i still think this was topnotch10 of 10,1,1,positive,
again like many other tv shows a certain actoractresses in thrust into the limelight in this case miranda cosgrove having built up her reputation in previous moviesseries especially by nickelodeon and dan schneider she is now the star of the show gets to sing the soundtrack which she did not write and thus gets even more fame from that wonderful it creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other costars especially nathan kress who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode except idont want to fight cosgroves music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song which was not written by her and other covers such as about you now and stay my baby lets not forget that she lip syncsings her song live too is that how you create vocalist nowadaysback to the show cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out bras and seen in many cases though not of the other actresses wedgies are mentioned panties have been mentioned once og let us not forget oh my god a come phrase are any of the scriptwritersactors christian granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids im surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female undergarment especially in the first episode where the phrase pointy boobs were mentioned im not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at homein school afterwards its not that im against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments which girls will wear but for a show from nickelodeon the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff i doubt that other nickelodeon shows have such content in themas mentioned is other reviews the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many partsfor example when the character sam cries how on earth is that a time to laugh it distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentenceas mentioned cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down see httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvkk0gtfuk98u jennette mccurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from cosgrove in the music industry compare the popularity of her new single vs cosgroves covers as noted the third costar nathan kress is the least noted of the lot he is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology his height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his characters crush on carlycosgrove beyond that kress isnt breaking into the music industry and as cosgroves fame grows with each episode kress falls behind i would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actorsthe content of the show is of course fictional but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times thus the laughter track is usedit also contains several continuity errors how can your father be and air force colonel on a submarine us special forces have their own branches and the air force doesnt use us submarinesthat is for seals a unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedyonce again it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments exposure of skin and over used laughter tracks it is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songsactions are excessive supported by her fans leaving her co stars behind,0,1,positive,
pitch black is a surprisingly good movie i was not a fan of vin diesel before i saw pitch black but after seeing pitch black my respect for vin diesel has gone up he did a great job playing riddick a man wanted for many murders his character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me like near the end riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die i like this movie and how it deals with human instinct this movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you dont need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie i think all the characters made this movie i give this movie 8 out of 10,1,1,positive,
i saw this movie with my mother and i loved it it was such a sweet story not to mention funny because of the supporting cast they never make movies like thisever my favorite part is when graceminnie driver finds out about her boyfriends wifes death and that she has the deceased wifes heart and she screams what was god thinking i do believe everyoneno matter who you believe in has thoughts like that once in awhile but while its very sappy it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for allsighthe comedic timing between bonnie hunt and jim belushi will just make you crack upespecially in the aforementioned scene its terrible and yet so funny they make a good pair and i hope to see them again in something soon 1010 stars,1,0,positive,

i went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for robin williams but when i saw it i realized i had bee lied to by advertisers as this is more drama than comedy although it has a few really good laughs in it it felt like i was watching two movies one was a funny romp with robin williams that should have been the whole basin for the movie anyway but you also get a techno thriller movie with political angst in the middle i really dont know how to classify this film but i can tell you it was good and i did laugh not as much as i had hoped but at least williams is back in the right direction see this but know before going it is not all comedy and is a little intense,1,1,positive,
its very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot for the viewer while some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves i embrace uzumaki for its irreverence there is a plot its just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer this is a film that invites numerous interpretations as all great art does however this film is also very entertaining making it a rare film experience its simultaneously provocative and fun,1,1,positive,
several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters the shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives all are transformed at the end of the movie adela antonia san juan leads a brothel her daughter anita monica cervera is retarded and has a restricted life leire najwa nimri is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend maricarmen vicky pea has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife isabel ngela molina is a bored rich ladyother characters are used to connect the five main women characters in storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience the shoetheme is driven to extremes for example when leire as a shoedesigner and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints she breaks one of her heelsin editing small connections are made between the scenes a telephone rings a cigarette is lit a song etc are used to make the connection and fast cuts frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching tvlevels it is strongly musicdriven to set tone and atmosphere the cities of madrid and lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters one of the more moving shots is when anita who makes the same walk every day widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road how the restriction of space is visually translated is well done as with most spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually using the soaplike stories as the simple backdrop there is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautifulas ramn salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level including the acting adelas love life isabels doctor the shoetheme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphorthis is often compared to magnolia because the structure is the same but they are different magnolia is more technically competent but somewhat mechanical this has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually after seeing this you are inclined to immediately move to the new moviecity madrid,1,0,positive,
its true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes and none more so that september 11 2001 a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorismno this documentary didnt set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 911 rather the filmmakers brothers gdon and jules naudet set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training and had handpicked their proby probation firefighter to join them in an ny firehouse home to ladder 1 and engine 7 but their production was to develop and contain at that time believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace centeri was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming and received a call at about 850pm local time from my dad who informed me of the above few minutes later he told me there was another and that the wtc was under attack by the time i arrived home the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke and to my horror they collapsed under an hourthe filmmakers had two cameras running that day one who had followed a team out on a routine call and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc1 where the first responders of firefighters paramedics and police had to make sense of what happened and to quickly develop a plan of action the other camera held by the other brother was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling and along the journey captured the many expressions of new yorkers as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhattenpeppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder 1 and engine 7 which miraculously did not suffer any casualty but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event through the events that unfold we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs to save liveswe began with what the documentary was supposed to be before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures its not a film that is fabricated and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary and heavens not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters its as close as you can get to that day witnessing the event up close from safetycode 1 dvd contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of ladder 1 and engine 7,1,-1,neutral,
mario lanza of course is the great caruso in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth dorothy kirsten eduard franz and ludwig donath this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary worldrenowned tenor whose name is known even todaythe film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza kirsten judmila novotna blanche thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film if youre a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from lucia will strike you as odd even if carusos wife dorothy just had a baby girl also its highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia the role lay too high for himin taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of carusos life what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in girl of the golden west there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga the reason for that photo his only shirt was in the laundry he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talkingmachine company later rca victor he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquakeinstead the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha which never happened he had a hemorrhage during lelisir damore at the met and could not finish the performance he only sang three more times at the met his last role as eleazar in la juive what killed him the same thing that killed valentino peritonitis his first role at the met was not radames in aida as indicated in the film but the duke in rigoletto so when it says on the screen suggested by dorothy carusos biography of her husband thats what it was suggested what is true is that dorothys father disowned her after her marriage and left her 1 of his massive estate they also did have a daughter gloria together who died at the age of 79 on 1072007 however caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothysome people say that lanzas voice is remarkably like carusos but just listen to caruso sing in the film match point carusos voice is remarkably unlike lanzas in fact from his sound had he wanted to caruso could have sung as a baritone he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings and the role he was preparing when he died was othello a dramatic tenor role which lanza definitely was not lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another he made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music he sings the music in the great caruso with a robust energy he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career his acting is natural and genuine ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herselfreally a film for opera lovers and lanza fans which are probably one and the same,1,1,positive,
tumbling doll of flesh aka niku daruma and psycho the snuff reels this was on my want list for quite a while and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back its never been on dvd and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvdr which im quite satisfied with the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on porn a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed the porn is definitely real with the annoying japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots without much success most of the time after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest this is after both legs have been severed her arm and a few other niceities this movie outdoes the guinea pig series by a long shot in fact they are not even close to the realism although cheap gore effects shown in this movie this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen if not the best now i must warn you that if you are not into this stuff you should stay far far away this movie is very strong and with the real sex it is in a very sick way erotic to an extent and i mean in a very sick way but wherever you come down on this subject material this movie brings the goods home and i would definitely recommend you seek it out after reading about the movie i was expecting something very strong but it exceeded that by a bunch,1,-1,positive,
i caught this movie on tv yesterday i had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by emilio estevez and starring him and his reallife dad martin sheen i love to see a movie about a fatherson relationship that involves a reallife father and son naturally theres an instant chemistry between sheen and estevez and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that theyre actually related of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors ive seen martin sheen in intense roles before but i think this is emilios most intense rolebeing that i mostly recall him from the mighty ducks seriesand i was very impressed talent really does run in that family and kathy bates steals the movie in an oscarworthy performance she tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue kimberly williamsthe beautiful actress from the father of the bride moviesis also very good holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors the movie is a bit stagey with dialogue thats obviously geared for the stage but that didnt bother me this is not meant to be an action movie this is a character study and for a film thats based on a play it never gets too claustrophobic when emilios character jeremy reminisces to his days in vietnam we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life the film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental at the end i expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunkydory but thats not how it turned out the ending made me cry without resorting to standard hollywood melodrama that proves reality is much more gripping than anything hollywood can conjure up if youre in the mood for a beautiful powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks offplease check out this underrated gem hopefully one day martin and emilio will unite with charlie and they will all make a great film together my score 9 out of 10,1,1,positive,

bottom of the barrel unimaginative and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far bad acting dialog effects dubbing pacing action sequences the list goes on and on italy made literally dozens of road warrior ripoffs in the early 80s some good some bad this is the worst by far no contest not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half there was 1 one good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding but everything else about this movie seriously reeks for actual postnuke fun go track down a copy of endgame after the fall of new york or escape from the bronx instead theyre much more enjoyable than this rubbish,0,0,negative,
brief summary this movie demeans everyone it touches that means youfirst off let me say im not a purist and this might have been funny for a few minutes the impersonations are not bad but overall its just dull and excruciatingly not funny a few simple jokes are repeated over and over againits clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the nowtrademarked laurel and hardy the producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history or their talents this is what offended me the mostof course my daughter liked it so im also a failure as a parent,0,0,negative,
separate lies is such an elegant intelligent and thought provoking film and i could have watched tom wilkinson forever on the screen the locations in the english countryside the marvelous london locations the interiors smart wardrobes and of course the writing and dialog made separate lies a thrilling adventurewith that said and perhaps this is just an american viewpoint as the british are so much more sophisticated in handling sexual escapades i found it hard to watch tom wilkinson just stand by as his wife goes merrily on her way in a sexual journey that really brings her very little joy creates much despair for her husband with the cad that is rupert everett yes i saw the failings of wilkinsons characterhis aim for perfection the desire for everything in its placebut in emily watson she should have looked deeper into his true character and solid goodness to realize what she has thrown awaytom wilkinson makes separate lies into a powerful film by watching him experience all the pain embarrassment and despair on the screen as his wife goes off with another man and he himself makes the journey in separate lies by understanding his faults embracing his wife despite all that has gone on and leading her back to london bravo tom,1,-1,positive,
for those of you who have a few kind words for this film i suspect you didnt see it when it was released as parts the clonus horror it was a dreadfully boring movie it missed the mark in at least three ways it wasnt good enough to be scary it wasnt bad enough to be funny although mst3k took care of that and even in 1979 the plot was unoriginalearlier contenders are the resurrection of zachary wheeler 1971 its the same idea clones as spare parts the movie is entertaining and it had a fine cast another is sleeper 1973 yes the woody allen movie remember the flattened nose and clones 1973 the last two plots arent as similar to clonus as the first one but they predate clonusthey are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea although often the word clone isnt used,0,0,negative,
im really tempted to reward the case of the scorpions tail with a solid 10 out of 10 rating but that would largely be because i think italian horror cinema of the 1970s is so much better than the cheesy crap i usually watch but even without an extra point for nostalgia this is still a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story uncanny atmosphere bloodsoaked killing sequences and superb casting choices in my humble opinion this is actually sergio martinos finest giallo and that has got to mean something as the strange vice of mrs wardh all the colors of the dark torso and your vice is a locked room and only i have the key are all topnotch genre achievements as well but this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultracompelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone madly out of control following her husbands peculiar death in a plane explosion lisa baumer promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and shes eager to leave the country as soon as possible due to the bizarre circumstances the insurance company puts their best investigator peter lynch on the case and he follows her to greece there lisa becomes the target of many assaults and the cases mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money im always overly anxious when briefly summarizing gialli because i dont want to risk giving away essential plot elements in the case of the scorpions tail the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway and i certainly dont want to ruin this for you many red herrings follow after that but sergio martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and even though not a 100 satisfying the denouement is at least surprising its also a very stylish film with imaginative camerawork and excellent music by bruno nicolai everyone s favorite giallo muse edwige fenech oddly didnt make it to this cast she stars in no less than 3 other supreme martino gialli but anita strindberg lizard in a womans skin who saw her die is a more than worthy replacement for her the charismatic and hunky george hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and duh ladies man deluxe if youre a fan of giallo dont wait as long as i did to watch this film,1,1,positive,
i dont know what this movie is about really its like a students art school project they never say why the world is dark but it is always darkness except for seconds a day there are long interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images a black woman enters the main characters apartment somehow she becomes pregnant overnight then gets shot in the head the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be honestly i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think its about but i wouldnt wish this level of hell on anybody else,0,0,negative,
this movie was awful i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through i didnt get the point of the movie what was the point of this movie the soundtrack was bad acting was bad and the story uninspiring the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting there was no chemistry among any of the cast members i dont know this for a fact but i suspect that most of the actors were first timers the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot that indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie i would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie i want those two hours back if you want to watch good funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons watch napoleon dynamite instead,0,0,negative,
ill not comment a lot whats to stereotype characters absolute ignorance about colombias reality awful mise en scene poor color choice not funny it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music its beside the nonsense scenes very poor actors direction if you see somewhere those people i mean the interpreters youll know they are at least good but seeing this so call film it is impossible to guess it you get tired of the music this comedy has no rhythm the only good rhythm in it its the rap sing in the final creditspathetic doesnt it etcetc it has been a long time i havent seen a movie so bad,0,0,negative,
i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors 1 speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe 2 the asian nurse who survived specks massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie this would have been impossible in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims 3 the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them not true in reality speck was at first calm and gentle reassuring the women he wasnt going to hurt them this is how he was able to tie each of them up 4 the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be fbi profiler robert ressler interviewed speck in the 80s and said that speck not only didnt know why he committed the murders but that he wasnt interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie if the story wasnt so tragic and horrifying the voice over would be laughable all in all doug coles performance is adequately menacing and coldblooded even though i dont think the real speck was so forward in his violence no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known after all for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them beverly ann sotelos performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film she is a very good actress if you are at all squeamish do not see this film its very graphic and disturbing,0,-1,neutral,

i watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when i should have been asleep this in itself was testimony that deliverance was a spellbinding movie i think boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film how expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done it showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were case in point near the end of the duel the banjoplaying boy was smiling loved his banjo but when drew tried to shake the boys hand after the duel the kid was too reserved to respond the river trip never left you bored for sure the rape scene was brutal but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of georgia i think beattys traumatic shock afterward was well done some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal i disagree if you really payed attention he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following in which reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy it was confusing when ed killed the other guy later at the top of the cliff it almost appeared that the arrow was shot while ed was curled up and expecting to die but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effectanyway a great movie and i was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a 1 i gave it a 10 this individuals reasoning seemed based on personal bias rather than an objective viewpoint and his vote was obviously a noncorrelating attempt to lower the rating,1,1,positive,
i felt brain dead ill tell you this is the worst film i have ever bought in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name the performances are so terrible they are laughable the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire the script promotes that kind of tv movie stare into the middle distance kind of acting the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani they have one look each and stick to it plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes avoid like a plague,0,0,negative,
this splendidlydirected fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm it is a firstclass adventure for many reasons i suggestfine photography strong imaginative qualities a delightful cast good simulatedjungle locales and a very exciting storyline johnny weissmuller plays tarzan a monosyllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs creation but he is honest loyal brave and very courageous and he needs to be during this narrative as jane parker his wife who had been jane porter in the novels maureen osullivan is very attractive and lively as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality the effect of the lighting the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm backlot which really works the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed but into their idyll come people searching from them emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated one is harry holt still in love with her who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him the gown and perfumes interest her but she refuses to leave tarzan tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals in scenes that look like a humanized king king the group claim to want to hunt animals and tarzan agrees for janes sake to a bit of big game trapping but at some point the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expeditions heads minds tarzan is shot left for dead and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous elephants graveyard but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call in a most spectacular elephantfilled scene he saves jane and what is left of the expedition who return home little richer but much wise as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband the film was directed by setdesign wizard cedric gibbons and quite beautifully too his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting filmwhich manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish neil hamilton is a very good harry paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally an unusual and wellrealized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well recommended,1,-1,positive,

i never much liked the myra movie tho i appreciate how it pushed the hollywood envelope at the time certainly miss welchs costume became an iconic image though i have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about i rewatched myra on fmc a couple of years ago and didnt think it had aged any better thru the years theres a segment about it in the sexploitation cinema cartoon history comic books where its given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production however imho the movie is too bitter to be charming too silly to be a turnon and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform engage or entertain,0,-1,neutral,
joseph conrads novel heart of darkness had a vivid sense of description that made this book astonishing when reading this book i had every scene totally drawn out in my head and i knew what every character looked like this book had many pieces and when i finished reading this book it seemed as the puzzle had been completed after i finished reading heat of darkness i watched the movie which was a mistake the movie cut out so many substantial parts for example in the novel marlow waited a very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat this was a big source of futility in the movie that part was just left out the movie added more parts that were useless and made no sense for example when kurtz was talking to marlow at the end of the book and kurtz snapped the monkeys neck and killed him what purpose did that scene have other than to make the audience feel sorry for the monkey its as if the script writer didnt even read the whole book and just put the parts that he read in the movie if i had not read the novel before i had watched the movie i would have been thoroughly confused the book was amazing and it is truly a classic in american literature but the movie could have defiantly been nominated for the worst picture in the razzie awards,0,-1,positive,
my dear lordwhat a movie lets talk about the special effects first dont get me wrong here i am not one of those effect fanatics but i was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past mainly the 60s so for some time i thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it but as far as i know they did not have cell phones in the 60swhat i am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message acting is secondary effects are secondary i do not even mind a few little inconsistencies however in a movies like this bad acting incredibility etc add up to make a bad movie even worse thats what happened for me with the celestine prophecymy wife said the book was actually really good and even though i am not into all that spiritual stuff i can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way the movie failed to do sothere could be one single reason to watch this one though if you really love cheesy movies itll be the right one for you if the imdb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality i must have rated this movie ten starsby the way three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there like critical mass look up the comments on that one hilarious the celestine prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree,0,0,positive,
this early john wayne lone star western has a bit more going for it than the runofthemill oaters wayne had been making for lone star up until that time for one it has his old friend paul fix in it fix being a much better actor then the standard lone star villain brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant linereadings often delivered in these oaters the plot about mistaken identity payroll robbery and murder is as trite and perfunctory as youd expect it to be in a 1930s lowbudget western but waynes strapping good looks easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable plump balding eddy chandler isnt quite believable as waynes womanizing partner and theres a running gag about something that happens whenever chandler and wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome on the other hand waynes love interest is played by none other than mary kornman the little mary of the early little rascals fame she is a grownup 20yearold now blonde and cute as a button most of waynes leading ladies in these lone starmonogram bs were fairly bland and colorless but mary is perky cute and yes sexy theres a scene in the general store where she works in which wayne asks her to get him a bottle of nerve tonic which happens to be on the top shelf so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf waynes ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps then again as she comes down then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935 wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt anyway its an interesting little b not great but not as choppy and random as many of his lonestar productions of the time the final gunfight isnt handled all that well and chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while but all in all its worth a look if only to see a cute and sexy mary kornman,0,1,positive,
one of the best war films i have ever seen if not the best it is very hard to talk about such films as it is very difficult to point at any film mistake made the problem is as it looks too real and by that drags you in to the ruins of stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides this is for the reason that this film unlike the most of hollywood films doesnt glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters instead of that the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is antiwar as much as the reason can offer extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces also german army is played by germans which is so convincing as well the film is produced and realized by germans where you can see their love for details to perfection this is the reason why stalingrad is one of the films i can watch million times and never feel dull i watched the film with my father who fought in wwii and the first thing he said was this is like real this is how the war against germans looked like this is the place you can see how did it look to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in human history and turning point of wwii stalingrad,1,0,positive,
like first blood this attempts to make a point about the treatment of vietnam vets but there really isnt much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire burnings stabbings torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible rambo takes out half of asia a ton of vietnamese soldiers most of the russian army various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at the only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is jerry goldsmith who carefully checks off all the clichd themes from russian ratatat to chinese chingchangchong just in case we dont quite understand who were looking at stallone has a brain in his head this empty nonsense is beneath him,0,-1,neutral,
as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies unlike others however i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever madethis occurs when harrys safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals the precensorship production values add a lot of realism genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle the film also offers though perhaps antecedently an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers in addition sexy jane thousands of elephants some great sets and two chetas not to be missed an adventure classic,1,-1,positive,

in the light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard that is typhoon ondoy i thought it upon myself to rewatch black rain 1988 japan shohei imamuras haunting blackandwhite masterpiece on the destruction and aftereffects of the atomic bomb that hit hiroshima in the closing period of the second world war the destruction and impact of both catastrophes war and typhoon may differ in degree and quality but the trauma and scar physically and psychologically nevertheless are still there it is a testament to a films power that its images remain as potent and as indelible as when they were first seen it is only that the difference now in my case is that watching those images has assumed a greater sense of poignancy and potency due to a firsthand experience of a nearmonumental weather calamity there is a sense of kinship so to speak imamura has always been one of my favorite japanese filmmakers his films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy sensuality and earthinessthe pornographersintroduction to anthropology 1966 eijanaika 1981 warm water under a red bridge 2001 his two palme dorwinners ballad of narayama 1983 and the eel 1997 to name some given the mood of his films who would have thought that he once served as an assistant director to yasujiro ozu japanese cinemas most austere and minimalist filmmaker but then it is ozus rigorous formality and domesticity that imamura was rebelling against but then again with black rain one can unmistakably sense ozus imprints the father or the fatherfigure being intent on seeing his daughter get married before time runs out on both of them and the stillness and calmness of the scenes showing all members of the family together notably the dinner scenes or in ozus film lexicon the tatami are something that the revered master filmmaker would perennially explore in his works tokyo story late spring essentially the overall subdued and deliberate quality of black rain is a remarkable contrast to the bacchanalian chaos and instinctual drive of imamuras entire filmographystill this is not to say that watching the film would not be an altogether unsettling experience black rain as aptly described by american film reviewer leonard maltin is filled with haunting blackandwhite images in the films first 15 minutes imamura pulls no punches in showing the immediate and graphic horrors of the nuclear bombing one after another stifflyburnt bodies hanging flesh walking dead fires and debris everywhere madness all over an assault to the viewers senses definitely it is coupled with takashi kawamatas somber bw photography he did the lensing in yoshitaru nomuras crime drama the incident and toru takemitsus chilling score he did the music in such classics as akira kurosawas ran and masahiro shinodas double suicide even during the films supposed tranquil phase that is five years after the atomic bombing one can still never have a sense of contentment and order with the uneasiness and pain still being strongly felt by the survivors not only in terms of failing physical health but more so in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma the human race it now indisputably appears has been destined to bear the legacy of the bomb for as long as it lives i already wrote a piece about black rain some years earlier posted in imdbcom but only in comparison to volker schlondorffs magnificent tin drum another film dealing with monumental human folly and global catastrophe moreover it has never been my practice to write twice about a film that i already wrote something about before it is in the light of the recent weather calamity that devastated our country that i was prompted to revisit and write something again about this remarkable imamura film as there is a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the film and the recent event in regards the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action and the longterm scars and wounds inflicted by a wide scale destruction whether human or natureinducedthere have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction testament threads the war game each situated within their own respective countriesand black rain stands among them if not more so for both its unapologetic and somber portrayal of individual and communal disintegration brought about by atomic devastation and the fact that it has a historical event as its basisfew weeks from now another disaster film from hollywood roland emmerichs 2012 will finally hit no pun intended the big screen as we all know this american directors bunch of disasterapocalypse filmsindependence day godzilla the day after tomorrow serves no other purpose than to be of mere entertainment value with no real insight into the nature and wisdom of apocalyptic disaster and the human condition being affected i wonder how this gigantic movie would exploit the trauma disorientation and apprehensions still being experienced by our people because of the recent weather calamity to say that this flick is a precautionary tale would probably be no more than an overstatement but yes i will still watch 2012,1,1,positive,
without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s gaots seems to really really want to be something important the tragic truth is that its so entirely valueless on every level that one cant help but laugh reaching in desperation for the earthy elements of ingmar bergmans films it follows a city couples day in the wildernessthey walk along a shady path allthewhile pontificating like a uc berkeley coffee clatch almost every line of tarradiddle dialog delivered here is uproariously badi feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this pomegranatebut is it as beautiful after what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happeningwellokwe are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene there is finally a very anticlimactic confrontation involving a pair nam vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk ballads with an acoustic guitar nothing at all eventful or interesting happens in this entire film i thought the larry buchanan picture strawberries need rain was a weak example of a bergman homage golden apples is every bit as bad but the ceaseless random verbiage it presents makes it memorably awful 110,0,0,negative,

this film is replete with sentimentality unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe and irrelevant material why introduce rachel for instance she has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her follow me truck to run wild and crash into dorindas fence that has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film another is at the end when the aircraft was it a b26 or an a26 both designations are used in the film is left with props whirling and no chocks in place that serves the plot of course but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler as it is the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control the ending again avoiding spoilers involves much too much talk as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches here dreyfuss just babbles on and on the ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilitiesimpossibilities that i wont describe what a dull and disjointed effort,0,-1,negative,
by the way it looks at the other comments made it seems that a lot of people did not get the point to the flick it is not centered around zombies as a matter of fact they are not zombies at all they are a device regenerated by the wizard to scare the girls to death his main focus is on meg tilly who he wants to help him finish the job that he died while doing in the first place and what you get is a great flick with an awesome ending it is hard to find on video but every once in a while it shows up on hbo or cinamax check it out i gave it a 10 and highly recommend it,1,1,positive,
this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died idaho colorado territories and montana it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious bad man good man the script is horrible there is very little direction and lousy acting dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade in real life jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city montana to insure that he could never terrorize them again vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately this is a horrible movie i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will even to this day,0,0,negative,
there is a reason why the world forgot these creatures they are dull this is a hammer production which means that whoever made this movie should be struck with a hammer several times if possible and where it most hurts most people put more thought into taking a dump than these idiots have put into making this movieseriously now the movie begins with some cavemen hunting an antelopething now antelopes must have evolved a lot from those prehistoric times because they actually attack and kill people here after that its time to meet the rest of the tribe more bearded men some fashionmodels and even a couple of very old greyhaired grannies and grandpas these old geezers obviously never heard about cave people not surpassing the age of 30 they refused to bow to the will of both logic and prehistorical records so they remain alive one of the cavemen isnt bearded he is cleanshaven not quite as cleanshaven as tarzan the lord of the humanoid cleanshaven ones roaming the jungle since childhood and without a razor but thereaboutswhat follows is the obligatory earthquakemoltenlava destruction sequence which causes a lot of our notsohairy friends to meet their doom it is interesting to note that before the earthquake the fashionmodels showed their breasts more after it they must have gotten shy or something because they covered their chests for a while maybe they were covered by ash so i mistakenly thought they were covered more action follows in the form of two fashionmodels wrestling in the sand the nextbest thing to female mudwrestling i suppose after a good deal of the desert has been crossed our blackhaired tribe meets how else could it be a blond tribe yawnmore spellbinding stuff follows there is that redhead fashionmodel who is bothered by seeing a caveteen kill a hedgehogthing there is also the scene of a woman dying at birth those cavefashionmodels are so frail eventually we get to meet an even darker haired and skinned tribe ie an evil tribe one of them becomes a wwf champion after he actually beats a huge bearthing in a wrestling bout 123 and its done the bear is the loser we also witness a jealous caveman miraculously recover from two major injuries first he gets stabbed with a big spear into the thigh yet he walks away from that as if it were but a scratch then he gets thrown off a cliff onto a big rock by the blond goodietwoshoes caveman yet he walks away from it as if he were thrown onto a giant sofa its unclear in the end whether he dies from falling off an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll being crushed oh yes voodoo was used in prehistoric times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashionmodels its always important to learn from moviesthe message of the movie is as insightful as it is educational cave people liked to fight for local power and they loved their fashionmodels too as if any selfrespecting caveman would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch,0,-1,positive,
the 1935 version of enchanted april manages to be simultaneously tediousand perfunctory it is difficult to show the transformative magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to belabor the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later rather than develop the screenplay flips a switch and thecharacters are differentthe husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells andor hostilitiesjessie ralph has the most fun moving instead of entirely chewing up thescenery and katharine alexander has some poignant charm out of herhusbands shadow and away from his hideous droning ann harding isunremarkable here with the production code being enforced she had anappropriate line in an earlier precode movie when ladies meet yourenot worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you but in enchanted april can only look hurt rush out and proclaim fealty to her errant husband,0,0,negative,
to start off with since this movie is a remake of a classic the rating has to be lowered already since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski it helpsisnt this just like the united states government though to terrorize one of its own citizens sounds like jason priestleys character from the movie but it is the truth the government would do anything possible to destroy a mans life for trying to get home to his wife a wife who is in labor no less and may not make itthere was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife the words of the disc jockeythere were some great shots of scenery in this film and great car chases and a lot of spirituality after much consideration i gave this film a 7,1,1,positive,
before this made for tv movie began i had relatively low expectations thats because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone there is no president sheridan delenn lennier londo vir gkar or lyta if you remember on the second to last episode of the series all the regulars except zack vir and captain lockley left b5 permanently now for this film they did bring back garibaldi who was not in the last b5 movie to join zack and the captain and the doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance but because so much is gone of the old chemistry this film already is severely handicappedthe movie is about a soul hunter martin sheen who is led to babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist ian mcshane a lot of spooky mumbojumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless yeah yeah the station nearly blew up but was saved and all but frankly i felt like it was a case of been there done thatand done that a lot better in the pastthe secondary plot provided more for comic relief was much more interesting as an entrepreneur installed a holobrothel and those in command werent sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close they were slapped with a lawsuit this was fluff but it did provide a few laughssomething the other dreary plot was surely lackingby the way sheen at first did a good job playing the should hunterwith his wild eyes and bizarre delivery however repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character this should have been spotted and correctedso the final verdict is this is only for total diehard b5 nuts like myself others seeing it might assume the series suckedwhich is a great injustice this is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit,0,1,positive,

i love this film the noir imagery combined with spillanes no nonsense character mike hammer works marvellously to create a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detective films of the early fifties it may not be the maltese falcon but this film makes its own solid contribution to the genre spillane is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc but his dames are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence poor old mike hammer as effectively played by biff elliott is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of an army buddy when the penny finally drops his face is a picture good to see that 50s censorship did not force the film makers to omit the famous last line a bona fide low budget classic,1,0,positive,

if it wasnt for the bad dialogues and script i mean the direction was really in touch with its subject the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life but in the end the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together i would highly suggest not to watch this unless youre a al pacino enthusiast like i am and will watch everything he is playing in even if the result lately are rather poor this is after s1m0ne a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles,0,0,negative,

my review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself 1 plants eating people have been done hundreds of times its been used by nintendo in everything from mario to zelda to metroid prime its been used in plenty of lowbudget 50s movies on par with the lowest of the godzilla franchise and this brings it to a whole another level of cheese with plants that talk ive known no one who walked out but i know a lot of people who absolutely broke out in hysteric laughing during parts of this movie i was one of them doesnt the horror genre deserve something a little better than this pile of laughable crap 2 the characters easily could have been copypasted from hostel or wrong turn or wolf creek or any other movie with collage kids with bad luck yet its called characterizing when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clichs that hundreds of characters before have had dont you ever wish a movie had characters that werent just forgettable pieces of meat with legs 3 this was not gory a guy cuts his skin off oh my not a guy gets his legs broken oh my gasp not i have shown movies like this to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick and she said ive seen pg movies worse than that why was it rated r so why was it rated r 4 heres the only plot the moviebook has collage kids drink have sex get naked cruse bleed and eventually die this is possibly the most typical example of a cheap thoughtless horror movie yet people call this mature what the 5 i do not think i have ever seen something less original sense i watched a beautiful mind havent you ever sat there and wished the horror genre easily the most diverse genre out there would do something well diverse something truly originali just wish more horror movies would have actual horror not just cheap collage parties put on film with a few splatters of fake blood tossed around110,0,0,negative,
three russian aristocrats soak up the decadence of monte carlo despite the fact they are down to their last franc in order to support their lavish lifestyle the three use the services of a counterfeiter and use the notes at the casinos hoping to exchange the bogus currency for a jackpot andrew hughes a us envoy arrives at monaco with his wife helen and the three decide to make pals with the visitors hoping for financial assistance one of the three russians count sergius karamzin plans to go further with continuous advance towards helen while disappointing the counts maid who loves sergius eventually circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats its obvious that von stroheim was trying to convey a message with the foolishness of american women and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats rather than tell a story and the film really can bore modern audiences like me easily by doing that even the acting which is great in later evs like greed and the wedding march is just run of the mill here the film could have used improvements on various levels rating 3,0,-1,positive,
i already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire there were numerous political and social messages the names make refer to some other names etc it might be i cannot realize such things i dont want to do anyway because i am not interested in i am interested in cinema as for the movie itself again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful i could not see anything which we dont see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half yes that scene says somethings about humanity but it does not make the movie brilliant the movie is entertaining mildly and exciting in some moments or scenes but no more than that as for the biggest flaw of the movie it is visual effects it was just shocking i could not pull myself together for a while because i had expected a realistic monster because it is not one of the old gojira movies it was made in 2006 but it was not it is like if you dont believe that there is a monster you cannot care about if you agree with me about this i highly recommend you cloverfield that is extremely realistic the design of the monster is not interesting but at least planned there is an effort dramatically powerful critique some critics talk about it as if it is a kurosawa movie yes it is rather a drama than a thriller or action but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful i dont want to compare the host with other monster movies but i try to mean that the host does not do something that other monster movies do not do by the way may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for asian cinema yes i like asian cinema too but this is the fact,0,1,positive,

after having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was is this supposed to be irony or not after reading a few comments about the character doc savage and the comic series i knew this film was not meant to be ironic so the story tells us about an usamerican superdoc saving a south american republic from evil sounds like a typical story but this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous the mandatory endfight shows the worst presentation of martial arts i have ever seen the film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example,0,0,negative,

i dont really consider myself a conservative so i wasnt personally offended by this film but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message and the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid or both the characters are onedimensional either good freedomloving americans or brainless greedy evil conservatives theres nothing clever or creative just anticonservative i dont really mind the political bias itself but it shouldnt be the only purpose behind the movie and clearly it ison the positive side the cast is wonderful and chris coopers impression of w is funny the first two or three times but after that its just the same old joke being told over and over againso if you really hate the conservatives youll probably enjoy this film but if youre looking for something with realistic characters and a story thats less blackandwhite then youd be better off watching something else,0,1,positive,

i was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight i must say i was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot i was completely mistaken this movie was not only incredibly entertaining but everything about it i simply loved bruce campbell was as amazing as ever the biggest surprise was none other than ted raimi you know sams little brother he played the mad doctors henchman to the greatest extent somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue he did nothing but shine but i really cannot ignore the magic that is bruce campbell though i did think that ted raimi stole the show bruce did what he does best on the big screen somewhere between the sketchy nasty american business man and the tragic victim he displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly attractive to audiences the movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers the crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie tookthis movie may not be oscar material but my goodness it was amazing i would highly recommend this to any bruce campbell fan also anybody that likes campy scifi movies do yourself a favor and watch this cant wait till this makes it out to dvdtake it as you want to the fed,1,1,positive,

this is an astonishing film a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs everything in it is beautifully filmed the women the apartments but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images almost every scene has echoes of another this is a story told in light in colour in many almostparallels every time i watch it it fills me with delightthe acting is great too romane bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown everything about her changes with her mood vincent cassel plays a very different role to his part in la haine but no less excellently shifty and sympathetic at the same time and monica bellucci ah monica bellucci well put simply she plays is the worlds most perfect woman theres one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile yet in that instant says more than hours of hollywood junkone cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb sequential climax sad shocking ironic and subtle in turn but if one moment captures the brilliance of this work its the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story yet when the moment comes it is handled so delicately so briefly so deftly that on reflection it makes you gasp only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point but the confidence is justified cinema doesnt come much better than this,1,1,positive,
this is the movie that pretty much sounded the death knell for the auteur in hollywood at over 40 million bucks heavens gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure what really galls me the most about it is that technically its very bad an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it john hurts commencement speech at harvard is inaudible as is a conversation between kris kristofferson and richard masur at the train station some people seem to think cimino intended this as a style he didnt its just bad sound recording the characters are not particularly welldrawn except for the four or five leads in the climactic battle scene its difficult to tell whos the bad guys and whos the good guys even on that level its impossible to enjoy the movie the casting of isabelle huppert as the town madam is a joke her french accent renders the whole character a fraud the acting is generally stiff without any range or depth of feeling even christopher walken is bad john hurts character is the only one with any swagger or vitality although hurt in his 40s playing a freshfaced harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous i guess to say that its overlong is overkill the rollerskating sequence could have been easily cut the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the twilight zone having rod serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale actually those scenes in and of themselves are not bad but cimino has not earned the right to include them because what hes given us as the meat of the picture is so incompetently bad the editing is poor especially in the grand battle climax at one point the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times i wish could i say something anything nice about this movie a great scene a great performance even one memorable line of dialogue but i cant it is all just one big unholy mess about the only thing i did like was the cinematography and the montana locations which are stunning even cimino couldnt screw that up this is a long boring bad movie by all standards and the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost overruns are just kidding themselves 12 out of 4,0,0,positive,

now dont get me wrong i love seeing half naked chicks wiggling around its part of the fun of a moroccan restaurant ogling the belly dancers but it doesnt make much of a plotmy first major problem is the music i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote the vampire lestat the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked though i could be wrong i know relating to current goth music might have seemed like a good idea but they did a horrific job incorporating it lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreakingsecond and someone else said it mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea lestat could have been a movie in its own right and a damn good one if done right i honestly dont think queen of the damned lends itself to a movie very well though i would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story theres too much how to word this inaction in the book for it to be a very interesting movie and the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly now mind you its been a long time since ive read it i always thought lestat tale of the body thief and memnoch the devil were much more action packed and would have made better moviesi know a lot of people hey myself included who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture i tend to agree with them there aaliyah had a nice body though,0,0,positive,
it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast like sh kasugi christopher lee and johnrhys davies it really is the perfect badventure of all time its actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with its flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if its made in the 90s it doesnt have a modern feel it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but im afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just cant hate it i think its an okay adventure movie and i really love the soundtrack damn i want the theme song,1,0,positive,
purple rain has never been a critics darling but it is a cult classic and deserves to be if you are a prince fan this is for youthe main plot is prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl believe it or not this movie isnt just singing and dancing there are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works very hit and missno one can really act in the film everyone is from one of princes side acts like the time and vanity 6 still it adds charm to the movie when ever prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak in conclusion go and see this if you love prince like me if you arent a fan itll make you one,1,-1,positive,
i saw this film over the weekend and while i was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of churchproduced films i left disappointed that this one fell so short failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questionsthe film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of joseph smith its not a true biopic because theres no real coherent narrative most of the episodes concern joseph doing good deeds playing baseball running races and laughing with children often in sloooow motion what a great just folks kind of guy that joseph was huh look at him out there beating rugs for his wife emma well howzbout the rugs of his 33 plural wives no mention whatsoever is made of polygamy a glaring omissionand it is in such omissions where the film falters it supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering why is joseph getting tarred and feathered why is he getting thrown in jail and why does that mob want to kill him the films climax is of course joseph and hyrums trek to carthage jail riding past a veritable united nations of faces looking out from nauvoos doorways but no mention is ever made about why nothing about smith suppressing the nauvoo expositor newspaper and ordering its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of polygamy the audience is left to wonder or to assume its just more baseless persecution of the church no mention of joseph being charged with treason for declaring martial law and calling out the nauvoo militiaof course i certainly did not expect this churchproduced film to present the joseph of richard bushmans recent biography rough stone rolling but i was surprised and taken aback at just how little of substance was actually presentedand worse what substance that was presented was often inaccurate two examples jumped out at me first the translation of the book of mormon the film shows joseph reading right off the golden plates in their tworing binder which plates in reality were hidden far from the site its well known that joseph did his translating by burying his face in his hat peering at the seer stone in there the second inaccuracy occurs at carthage jail where the mob storms the cell the history of the church reports that joseph had a sixshooter and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the masonic signal of distress as reported in times seasonsmaybe showing the reality of the gunfight would have shattered the hearttugging mood the filmmakers had created but by omitting it they were unfaithful to history and failed to show joseph as he really was handy with a gun and able to defend himself in fact the impression the film gives is that joseph was a nice guy but also something of a milquetoast that everybody beat up tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood he was far from that joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardship and struggle to bring to fruition that in which he believedsee the film but know going in thats its cotton candy then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of bushmans biography of smith rough stone rolling ps churchproduced films have no credits but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces rick macy is excellent as joseph smith sr and bruce newbold beloved as thomas in finding faith in christ here plays the cranky methodist minister who failed to show christian love to a young seeker after truth,0,1,positive,
i went to see this movie with the most positive expectations i had seen jacquets previous movie march of the penguins and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio however i was severely disappointed most of all this movie is terribly boring literally nothing happens i tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend and we both ended up laughing because i could only stammer things like well then the winter comes and then spring and then theres an eagle and a river and one time it is dark and the girl goes into a cave and another time the fox has babies and so on after about half an hour i began sighing yawning rolling my eyes cursing the reviewer at the radio station and hoping that it would be over soon but the movie went on and on when it finally ended i had sunken so deep into my chair that i must have looked somewhat similar to stephen hawking the most annoying parts of the movie are a the girl who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with she wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie one year and shows exactly two facial expressions joy and seriousness she is cute no question about that however a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her alltoohuman presence i found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear drown in the river or something similarly terrible b the commentary by the girls adult voice which tells us nothing but negligible obvious boring redundant things c the music which is desperately lacking subtlety when the girl is happily jumping around the music jumps around too when the fox is threatened by an eagle the music becomes threatening too it reminded me of the very early days of filmmaking and was just too predictable to enjoy admittedly many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it at least they got somehow involved thus my warning concerns adults only if you are over ten years old avoid this movie you can get a better and cheaper sleep in most other places,0,0,negative,
michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the topbilled character in the golden child and because he loves kids that didnt work and why should it so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing kid midas i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actors inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy adventure comedy thats a step closer to ishtar whatever murphy says or does can be best liked but dont get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent he doesnt belong in this movie and the same went for dr dolittle the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic and that wouldnt have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy speaking of visuals they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagans presidential fame murphy is far better at coming to america and 48 hrs but this stale movie isnt my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste,0,1,positive,
plunkett and macleane is a wonderful updating of the swashbuckling tradition predating johny depp and his pirate friends the tone is lighthearted with a touch of social commentary but nothing too heavy one could almost see errol flynn and basil rathbone in thisit starts out in low gear with the introduction of the characters and the establishing of the themes of social inequality and rebellion but it kicks into high gear once the boys hit the highways the robberies are grand and stylish with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of swashbucklers the actors are engaging and help elevate the material a bit which is fairly hollow theres not much depth to the figures but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesnt mattermuh has been said about the modern music period music tended to the more serene which seems out of place a classical score with celtic rhythms for the action pieces could work but the more modern rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add an edge to the action since the characters are more legend than reality accuracy in the music seems pointless the pieces tend to fit the mood of the aired scenes so it mostly works well i just wonder how they missed adam ants stand and deliver make no mistake this is not a serious film its pure escapism and a wonderful lark tony scott shows some of the visual flair of his father but i dont think we are going to see many oscar nods in his career just yet he seems to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film with time he may prove to be a name to reckon with his father took a while to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more rounded director this is definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a swashbuckling film fest,1,1,positive,

sick of the current cinema output particularly american cinema ive been making an effort to see the oscarwinning foreign films thats when i came across this gem slow to start it picks up nicely once war is declared basically an old fashioned girlwaitsforboytoreturnfromwarstory the performances the cinematography make this so very much more why tatyana samojlova as the young woman didnt become an international star after this is beyond methough she has remained successful in her own country you take the journey with her young defiant impetuous young girl who through the ravages of war becomes a very sober somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope her final scene is devastating we love her as much as the camera does and the camerawork was this the pioneer in handheld camera work it truly adds an immediacy to the story and the beauty of it like when tatyanas character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence i am humbled and grateful to see this film,1,-1,positive,
the premise of this movie is revealed on the dvd box a textile worker develops a miracle fabric that doesnt degrade but the movie fails to get on with it instead it pads for 45 minutes noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery since audiences dont benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out its a strange choice the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic once the fabric is discovered the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs and bluecollar coworkers want the invention squelched leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements inventing the chemical and running from oppressorsi cant understand why anyone would describe this as comedy the tone isnt funny or comical its more like serious social criticism of the day that capitalism warps both supply chains and production which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world yes thats probably true but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact the movie is simply an earnest argument youll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any herethis is more like a british meet john doe meet nigel doe,0,-1,neutral,
final scorewho cares its a reality show it has no love for its audience it panders to lazy tv viewers puts nothing in and gets nothing outjoe millionaire the most blatantly phony reality show of them all is a television disaster of epic proportions its a watershed rock bottom moment not only for fox but for the american viewing public who actually watch like and talked about this crap the next day you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves because as much as fox promotes this junk it wont make any money unless its watch by people and boy was it the finale got nearly super bowl numbers it doesnt bother you people that there are many quality shows written directed acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless cold game showi used to be a staunch supporter of fox its those of us like me who like and seek out quality tv that helped build fox back in the days of marriedwith children and the simpsons conveniently enough now neither of those shows would make it 6 weeks with the current management the gail berman reign of terror as its often called the network has waged war on scripted tv and strangely enough its fans the very people who helped build them in the beginning now not only do we have to fight for good shows but we have to fight against their own network it boggles the mind nothing fox has done in the past 3 years makes any sense from canceling hits like titus futurama and john doe nbc can renew boomtown but fox cant lift its pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot and the reason they can do all this the success of junk like joe millionaire they can now say we dont need you tv fans we have reality shows they apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and will abandon them the second the next fad comes along to alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back abcthe show itself is a joke here we have a premise in the now classic fox gimmick that promises us something different and edgy but then delivers something not in any way different from the bachelor or anything on the big 3 fox has gone mainstream the finale and twist quoteunquote showed they have no ideas up their sleeve now we know that all these shows no matter how different they look will all end up the same cornball fairy tale ending we got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actors that the network picked out of millions of headshots to fit their demographics parade around like high school bimbos pretending they liked this evan marriott becausewell because it was a competition and thats what youre supposed to do marriott himself is like a hideously disfigured chromagnum man who struggles to put together the simplest sentences but how can the women all average to ugly looking by the way an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this not fall for joe with such charming lines like look youre not stupidi used to think that people who watched these realitydatinggame shows were just to lazy to change the channel but after joe millionaire i think they must be genuinely mentally deficient come on people have a little more pride in yourselves demand a little bit more from your entertainment then thisboycott fox,0,-1,positive,
ive seen about a half dozen of the low budget poverty row b westerns that ken maynard made in the 1930s and i am consistently amazed at how poor an actor he was how did he ever get to be a leading cowboy actor they say that he could ride pretty well back in the silents but he doesnt do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films still maybe he got the leads because he was big and could ridephantom rancher isnt as bad as some of the other ken maynard films ive seen but it still isnt much some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a young fella where it appears to me that hes just as old as the other older actorsand if thats not silly enough theres a rather significant script problem in this film at one point one of the characters makes a remark about how the phantom had prevented the poisoning of a well something that hadnt happened yet just a couple of minutes later we then see that particular scene no it wasnt a flashback at first i thought perhaps that when treeline films was doing the dvd transfer they might have reversed two of the reels but in those days film reels contained approximately 11 minutes of film and the whole reversal only took about 3 or 4 minutes tops everything else was in a logical order so it looks like that was a genuine continuity problem in the original film maybe thats one reason why colony pictures didnt last very long,0,0,negative,
everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful i wasnt going to comment but the film just bugs me so much and the writerdirector in particular so i must toss in my hat to join the naysayersi saw the original wicker man and really loved the cornucopia of music sensuality paganism in a modern world and the clash of theological beliefs this said i am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldnt be done for example i liked the original 1950s invasion of the body snatchers but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake both films can stand on their own another example is the thing the original as campy as it looks compared to todays standards has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with kurt russell my all time favorite horror movie so that small minority of people who like the wicker man remake can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because its a remakethis film solidified for me neil labutes sexism and misogynistic tendencies it also made me wonder how executives wanting to make a serious thriller would green light a product that is so antifemale there are too many scenes of cage hitting women just because hes frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects arent forthcoming the original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a goddess based religion the threat to the main character came from everyone male and female there was no sexual hierarchythe metaphor of bees drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient the drone must die especially when cages character has bee allergies i kept wondering why the men on the island didnt fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts these were not women with special supernatural powers and half of them seemed to be pregnant the other half old and fat and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women physically dominate them there didnt seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy but if they were content being drones why make them unable to speak they could be used as a threat to cage because they will defend the community they are drones because neil labute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated that movie was made already the stepford wives anyone classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sht together and were truly equal citizensthe problem with the manhating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when cage starts knocking women out i belief labute shouldve left the society an egalitarian one kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island no one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited so how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around there would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused thus an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children labute has said he created the fianc and daughter story thread to give cages character an incentive to search i dont think you need that any child abused will make an adult react to save them the irony of course would be that the child cage saves ultimately brings him deaththe dialogue was contrived and campy the whole third act was hilarious the audience i saw it with guffawed and later booed at the end i just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded cage is we dont need that just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child most of us in america have seen law order and other cop procedurals we come into the movie as if we are cages partner solving a mysteryso much potentialwasted neil labute stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angstridden plays and flicks of that sort stay with your own company of men leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers here is your jar of honey ill watch that,0,1,positive,

boogie nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any wouldbe filmmaker should take a long hard look at sure you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from hitchcock to scorsese but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study halfheartedlywhere to begin i suppose one could look at the film as simply a story perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970s porn industryand what an industry it was the other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and ahem rubber but honestly boogie nights brings back the pure nobulshi in your face kind of cinema i havent experienced since the film greats of the 1970sironicor stroke of genius the story is full of richly detailed characters all of which you either can relate too love or hate but the impact is clearyou are feeling something for them among the characters the two performances which stand out are burt reynolds as director jack horner and mark wahlberg as eddie adamsdirk diggler julianne moore is also brillant as is heather grahambut if i focus on any one actor it would have to be john c reilly johns performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotionim a sucker for the line ever see the movie star warspeople say i look like han solo anyway the look of the film is incredible the director of photography and directorwriterproducer have come up with a vibrant colour and flashy style that compares to martin scorsese and stanley kubrickin terms of his perfection of his craft but with creating his own unique look and pushing the edge with the longest single shot iver ever seenthat being the new years party sequencethe music like in any great film is a character of its own at times it consumes oneself with sorrow or griefbut mainly its all about fun dancing and having a good time the spirit of the 1970s ok back to the performancesburt reynolds plays the character of jack horner a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of film means to his genre the awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape the lose of his art as it wereand the changes in mentality to the people he works with walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character for all those individuals who have seen burtons planet of the apes pay no attention to the performance of wahlberg in that filmrent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can makejulianne moore plays the wouldbe mother to all and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels as life imitates art and she loses all those close to her heather graham is the eyecandy but later holds her own and steals some of the scenes from even the great mr reynolds himself each character is multidimensional rich with life and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the partthe film itself is often funny tragic exciting and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fastpace 1970s it makes no excuses and tells no lies and offers the audience a trip back but even more importantly the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film,1,-1,positive,

this excellent series narrated by laurence olivier brilliantly it should be said charts the beginning to the end of world war 2 the origins are not entirely examined fully from germanys fall at the hands of the versailles treaty which helped propel hitlers demonic rise but as one reviewer says that must be hard to do in a 26part series with so much to cram in apart from the expected combat photographyaction there are plenty of personal emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight especially if youre not necessarily a world war 2 bufffan episodes showing testimonies and what life was like on the home front of the main alliesadversary britain germany japan russia and the usa were quite eyeopening showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians the death camps etc were very well handled and exposed id fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation of which it could be said i am one at 47certain things are quite strangely left out like the advent of the new jet era beginning with frank whittles experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteors combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me 262 especially as the v1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v2 this is probably a small oversight not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww2 brought forward from a more barren old science but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated a series to own as a box set in history terms on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan jeremy isaacs and thames tv should be well proud,1,1,positive,

i loved this excellent movie farrah fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart she plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger after being rejected by the police she realizes she is on her ownthen one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again not being about to call the police or get him out she is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprisons him in her fireplacei think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land they are too easy on these criminals its time for more harsh punishments,1,1,positive,
once upon a time quentin tarantino was a relatively successful filmmakernow unfortunately he not only makes terrible films but puts his names to ones like thisa supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s this plumbs new depthsbelieve you me i enjoy it when a blouse falls off in a film more than the next man but even i felt kind of sleazy watching this to use a word i never thought i would its msysoginistic you see i cant even spell it the plot in the vaguest sense of the term is as incomprehensible as vinnie jones accent the fact his terrible acting does not stand our particularly is as damning a testament as one can think ofthis is just terrible shocking it almost made me cry in horror,0,0,negative,
i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary what i love most about it is that it is understated and lowkey but deeply heartfelt henry thomas he played the child in et performance is masterfully inarticulate he is supposed to be a man of few words david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain and miraculously given that were talking about a hollywood product here a baby serves as a main character but one who doesnt act or have lines but rather just is is luminous at that interesting to note that thomas mysterious relationship w et was the core of that film while his bond w the baby serves as the core of a good babythen there is the musicah what music gillian welchs tunes are wonderful the entire score is gorgeous hill country musicthis film is wonderfully atmospheric i recommend it highly,1,1,positive,
54 is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era it features the classic goodlooking bartender the sexy females the high powered owner the partying when all entwined together chaos ensues and the bartender played by phillipe seems to be at the brunt of it allim going to be as blunt and honest as possible whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments like its an ok film i really do find it a completely dire film complimented by its dire cast every time i sit down to watch a film casting salma hayek i am always awaiting to see her beauty radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance but reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is i mean really what has she ever bequeathed the masses with other than her immense table dance in from dusk till dawn the same goes for ryan phillippe another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as acting mike myers isnt quite as bad as these 2 he does at least give the film something worthy playing the seedy extroverted cofounder of the 54 club the type that the majority watching would hate ie job well done he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick but alas it is not enough to rescue the film from its baseless and flat nothingness most bad bad films i find something to take from the film but this has nothing to it really neve campbell isnt too bad but she is just there the storyline is dull it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else any meaning any class anything at all because like most ornaments they are just hollow pointless objects that are merely pretty to look at much akin to the basis of this disastrous filmgenuinely an hour and a half of time i could have spent better doing something much more exciting like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather,0,0,positive,
i hadnt laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall this one was definetely fresh and witty if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings only a few women have voted i dont want to ruin the movie for you but im sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score why because the movie puts men in their place thats why if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to menit could easily be a 7 rated movie,1,0,negative,

its a shame that asterix and his buddy obelix do not get the world wide recognition that other cartoon comic characters getthis is another funny asterix cartoon jammed with entertainment the animation is excellent and the voice characterization good even if the synchronization is a little out the music and score fit well within the story and the slotting in of some modern musical numbers is a nice touchthe running time seems short and while its not the best asterix story or the most developed cartoon its good clean fun the modern disney like animation will capture children asterix fans and new comers enjoy the gaul adventure,1,1,positive,

a genuinely odd surreal jumble of visual ideas which probably looked extremely puzzling on the printed page just what drew robert redford to the project one may never know sidney j furie directs this knockabout journey of an egotistical motorcycle racer taking a milquetoast juvenile under his wing the kid looks up to this antihero and eventually begins to ape his amorality disjointed and offputtingthough for some the sight of redford disrobing about to disrobe or having been disrobed might be enough to warrant attention lauren hutton gets naked too however all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the prurientminded there simply is no story perhaps furie was making an esoteric comment about feckless wheelers and their flock circa 1970 if true then this preblank generation approach backfired as the film was not a success 12 from,0,-1,neutral,
gary busey did a splendid job playing the rocknroll legend buddy holly193659 he does have a spitting image to the man being a garage band in the 50s is sure different from todays having a group of three is usually simple back in those days i bet that buddy hollybusey was a much better musician than most of what i heard since he lived in lubbock texas it was only a quiet country town back then his parents were christians though his mother was a strong supporter of her sons work thats one of the reasons he didnt act like elvis he stuck to his kinder ways that really makes him good when he went to tennessee he saw how bad the producers were they hated rocknroll that turned holly off big time getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge to holly and his friends he got to tour with sam cooke went to the famous apollo which the allafroamerican audience quickly accepted them i liked that and sam cooke made sure holly and his band got some service thats what i call tolerance its sad that he ritchie valens and jp the big bopper richardson had their music careers cut short by a plane crash in 1959 at least their memories will live on in our hearts i dont what inaccuracies were in the movie all i care is that buddy holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics in that time and the music is nearlyperfect for gary busey he was perfect in the role and making the music as well god bless you gary busey 5 stars,1,0,positive,
this film played in lexington ky for 7 days i saw it on the last day of its run regretted that i could not recommend it to others because this is a film that cries out for the big screen experience the aerial shot where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two lead characters flirt on deckalmost a ballet and sexier in its suggestiveness than so many more explicit films these days i just cringe to think that more people wont have the opportunity to see this fine film in a theater the dvd experience will not be the same heres an idea if you live in a college town see if you can lobby for it to show up in a campus film festival,1,-1,neutral,
i was about 12 years old when i saw this classic casper the friendly ghost cartoon figured it was an early one since casper didnt look right the same way porky pig doesnt look right in the old 1930s cartoons but i digressanyway this episode in the friendly phantoms afterlife concerns him befriending a young fox todd whom he names ferdie i remember being happy to see casper have a friend as those who have watched the cartoons are wont to know that most people run away from him screaming a ghostcasper and ferdie have some fun together until someone else shows up i hate to leave you with a semispoiler but the cartoon is only seven minutes long so you cant really be too ambiguous besides anyone who reads the imdb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what happens nextthe finale is a bit heartbreaking in fact its probably the saddest ive ever felt watching a cartoon but that only means that it moved me which probably explains why i decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not very many others or heck the fact that i actually remember this cartoon at all is due to its emotional effect on me i havent seen it since but the cartoon does end on an upbeat note and i was pleased to see casper and ferdie happy againid give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars second only to the warner bros cartoon peace on earth this is the most ive ever been moved by an animated short,1,-1,negative,

holy crap the beginning picked up where the first one left off good start then it goes downhill from there you it looked like as if you were watching tv and you keep on switching between this teenage soap opera a predator movie and some crappy detective show the characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes dont have anything to do with each other until the final 45 minutes or so the characters of the teenage soap opera and the actual alien storythen for the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a nuke on the cityps what the crap is the deal with the cameras being so zoomed in you cant tell whats going on seriously movie makers do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight,0,-1,neutral,
girlfight is much more of a comingofagestory than it is a fight flick and what a relief to have one in an urban school with naturalistic realistic latinos and believable use of brooklyn project settings it made me realize that virtually all hollywood high school movies are set in luxurious suburbia or small towns even the somewhat comparable love and basketball which focused on teen africanamericans was set in suburbia while these kids share some of the same peer problems those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids where high school graduation could be the major accomplishment of their livesthe feminist element here is riveting in its originality as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationshipand a victory on her terms a lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a genderbendingexpectations situationthe movie does drag a bit here and there but this is no cheap thrills rocky fight movie as the practices and fights have complex outcomes and all the relationshipsespecially with fathers and fatherfigures take more center stage than the center ring there were lots of interesting music credits listed at the end but i hadnt really noticed the songsoriginally written 1072000,1,-1,positive,

i have to admit i laughed a few times during this trivial 2004 holiday movie but its already moving out of my shortterm memory in a career that is sliding rather swiftly toward tabloid obscurity ben affleck once a promising comic character actor who became enmeshed in the hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man judging from this film the transformation doesnt seem to be taking as he continues to lack the gravitas that would make him credible in such parts while his buddy matt damon takes on smart roles in films like syriana affleck appears in this type of commercial pap at least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive drew latham suits affleck better than most of the other roles he has trieddirected by mike mitchell whose most famous film is 1999s deuce bigelow male gigolo and scripted by no less than four screenwriters always a bad sign the flimsy plot revolves around his characters need to rent a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the oldfashioned christmas he never had the concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the cathartic release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the frenzied commercialism around the holidays the real problem however is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional resonance affleck seems to be on overdrive attempting desperately to be lovable but the net result is an exhausting turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in illconceived films fortunately he has the likes of james gandofini and catherine ohara playing the valcos the couple who decide to accept drews monetary offer to pretend to be his parentsgandolfini plays tom like a gruff nonviolent relative of tony soprano but he does what he can in the role from her classic sctv days to christopher guests mockumentaries ohara is always a comic gem no matter the vehicle and unsurprisingly she earns the best laughs as toms wife christine whether dryly delivering a oneliner or posing in an inch of makeup for a dominatrix photo shoot in what is becoming her standard screen role christina applegate plays their mistrusting daughter alicia who of course becomes drews love interest despite some good moments where she is enjoying the deceit of playing drews sister in front of his girlfriends family her character seems to change in lightningflash strokes making it hard to see what drew would see in her the story spins completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation piled on top of another until plot strands are tied together in short order its rumored that much of the movie was improvised since there was no finished shooting script it shows but i also have to admit i stuck with it to the bitter end,0,0,positive,

its a soapopera drawing upon an applied ethics idea a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie i didnt get any emotion from it the ideas are not at all new the tension lacks it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way i mean you have this middleaged paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than don juan he doesnt seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years he has no issues with god and one would probably expect that too the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves i cant get out of my mind bergmans cries and whispers similar to this one in many respects which simply bursts with emotions and not all of them humane etc this movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but dont expect to be blown away the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer amenabar doesnt rub your face in it and he doesnt take sides he doesnt want to make us fanatics for a particular idea still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded,1,-1,positive,

baby face is one of the better of the forgotten films before the code it was shown last night after the 1931 version of waterloo bridge on the turner classic network so i was able to watch the film as it is now with four plus minutes of it restored stanwyck is living in east st louis where she may have known the drunken parents of myra mae clarke in waterloo bridge her father is robert barrett she has lived with him since the death of her mother and in the restored dialog he has been pimping her since she was 14 years old now she is resident waitress and parttime whore in his speakeasy her closest friend being chico theresa harris the africanamerican servant who barrett keeps bullying it is one of the two good points of stanwycks personality that she keeps standing up to her father about harris threatening to leave if harris is fired and since it is the grubby workers like nat pendleton who enjoy seeing stanwyck serve them rather than the flavor of the hooch he serves that brings them in barrett has to obey herthe one guy who comes to the speakeasy regularly whom stanwyck likes is the shoemaker and intellectual adolf cragg alphonse ethier who sees great potential in the spirited girl if she will just leave her forsaken home he is also pushing the philosophy of friedrich nietzche and the idea of the will to power more about this laterafter she knocks out the local political bigwig arthur hohl and has an argument with barrett about this a still explosion kills barrett and enables stanwyck to leave her home town she and harris head to new york city managing to get free transport by a railroad freight car by sleeping with a brakeman james murray they reach new york and after walking about they see the gotham trust company established 1873 and the friendly guard tells her where the personnel office iswe slowly watch stanwyck ascend the corporate ladder to the top similar but sleazier than robert morse dared in how to succeed in business without really trying but morse was a man in a man dominated company stanwyck knows her sexual allure is her weapon she goes through john wayne douglas dumbrille a section of the film that i always felt was the most shocking curiously enough when i watched it douglas wood henry kolker and finally george brent each ends up falling for her and either being pushed aside when no longer useful or destroyed by her brent the new president of the bank his grandfather founded eventually marries her and the crisis of the film is when the banks economic situation is shaken especially after brent buys her a fortune in jewels and gives her valuable bonds brent is indicted will she stick up for him spoiler coming up the one thing about these films that is not admitted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated endings the original ending had stanwyck boarding a ship for europe abandoning brent to his fate but realizing she cant do it to him returning to their apartment house and finding hes shot himself she is riding with him to the hospital as it ends now before the rediscovered footage was found the film ended with them apparently giving up all their money to the bank to save it and retiring back to east st louis to live happily if poorneither of these are good endings stanwyck should continue on her destructive course with brent the last of her victims but even without the breen office the script writers one is darryl zanuck by the way saw fit to have her find a moral center she has none at least none for powerful men whom she hates i dont think that a depression audience would have tolerated that type of conclusionthere are other problems due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society it was a mans world in the corporate world in 1933 so stanwyck has her work cut out for her wood when she is going to be fired for an indiscretion with him admits that he did not want her to work but in 2006 stanwyck would have been finding woman all over the place in the film there are nasty catty remarks obviously some based on jealousy towards stanwyck from other secretaries and female employees at her rapid rise in 2006 shed be frequently confronting women superiors and she would find them cutting her off at the legs very quickly of course if she finds one or two are lesbians she might try that road but it is doubtful and she also never seems to meet any men who are gay they do have gay male executives in business who wouldnt give a damn about her legs or breaststhen there is her mentor mr cragg cragg is remade in the bowdlerized version into trying to make her seek a moral center in reality he pushes nieztsche but the way in a broader sense the nazis pushed nieztsche find your way to power and push it while nieztsche did stress power sometimes it wasnt the beall and endall of his theories otherwise nobody would read him today in college courses cragg is obviously selfeducated but only halfeducated in short if somebody who thoroughly studied nieztsche confronted cragg hed make him look like a halfeducated fool and this is stanwycks mentor a good film and for its day worth a 10but seriously

this has to be one of the best movies to come out of hk in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with sam lees impossibly believable insane behavior and edisons portrayal of a killer machine which totally reversed his normal idol image i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie however i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe makes you think about what is life about really,1,1,positive,

theres hardly anything at all to recommend this movie chase masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act though her role in this clunker is a waste unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre in a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference no such luck here creature unknown a clichd monsterontheloose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other the monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of paul blaisdell so bad its good the rest of the show is just so bad its bad a little humor might have made this more palatable but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up there is a twist or two at the end but by then you wont care anymore,0,0,negative,
i was born in 68 with not much parental guidance as far as what i watched on tv as a kid in the 70s i always loved this movie and the french connection and would always try to catch it whenever it was on checking the sunday tv guide ahead of time i bought it on dvd a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and i must say i still love it roy s was a great actor from the 70s jaws is one of my alltime favs marathon man etc and although the 7ups is not an oscarworthy film it puts you precisely in a time a place ny early 70s as did french connection and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time and yes the car chase is one of the alltime best,1,1,positive,

spoilers bruce willis the parttime comic and funny guy plays a hispanic assassin nicknamed after an african scavenger prairie dog i guess all the good hispanic nicknames like sicatriz scar scorpion viper cobra snake tarantula latigo whip navaja blade etc were not available and why would some south american assassin be acquainted with a terrorist from the irish republican army last time i checked the ira is not looking to open any branch headquarters in south america and why would some prisontough battleweary irish terrorist look like a middleaged richard gere i thought maybe this movie was going to be a spoof of the crying game when geres character was introduced as the person who was going to hunt down the jackal what bad casting and why would the fbi be hiring depraved terrorists in order to track down assassins it seems like a terrorist goes for mass destruction and an assassin usually hits one target in a nonspectacular manner but gere is the only person who has ever seen willis alive according to the fbi i thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the very great film day of the jackal but this movie is just a dumber version of assassins with stallone and banderas both of these movies are really dumb and part of the dumbness is the fact that as the audience we are forced to watch bruce willis go through his routines and we should say wow isnt he smart the professional with jean reno was a much better movie about assassins the jackal is just a movie about two fat middleaged millionaire actors who could get paid for standing around looking pretty and pretending to be smart the jackal is so poor that i expected to see sly stallone dennis rodman mickey rourke and jean clod van dumme making cameo appearances as other hitmen or fbi needless to say the jackal has eluded the fbi for twentyfive years but as soon as richard gere gets on the job it is only a few days before the jackal is kaput i guess the positive message of this movie is thanks to terrorists our streets are safe from assassins overall the jackal has no redeeming qualities,0,0,positive,

this is a very very odd filmone that is so odd its best you just see it for yourself the film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is you can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynicfinding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of selfimportance additionally he seems tired and bored with the monotony of lifelater in the film he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head oddly this is only halfway through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life this is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professors novelsone that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say themsee this weird filmits amazingly compelling and not like anything ive ever seen before,1,1,positive,
well its ten years on since this film was released and the sands of time have not improved it one bit again like the other comments made the aussie film makers should have a little more drama rather than middle class aussies riding around beautiful places on there bikes with not much in the was of dialog middle class is not funny nor is rich there is also a mish mash of cast why is a young woman going to marry a man old enough to be her father it escapes me its such a shame about this film looks like a wonderful place to holiday thou anyway its an hour and thirty mins of my life i will never be able to get back lifes to short to watch this movie,0,1,positive,
the film is really good it doesnt use violence or sex etc to sell itself like other films but instead just uses a really decent plotbased on the original by michael caine and some great actors to make a fun action packed film which i thoroughly enjoyed one thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as edward nortonwho i last saw in 26th hour which i enjoyed also jason stathamtransporter enjoyed that also and seth green who i think is great his role as shawn fannings roommate dubbed the napster is hilarious and his hacking skills play a great part in the main heist which centres around a large traffic jam in la the car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive i havent seen the original so i cant really compare the too but i liked this a lot and would highly recommend this film to everyone it isnt a film where you need to like that specific genre it will suit everyone i felt good after this movie it had a really good ending and was overall really fun to watch i give it 810 go watch it,1,1,positive,
the reviews i read for this movie were pretty decent so i decided to check it out bad idea this is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends the story is stupid mix two parts ringu with one part prom night a sprinkle of i know what you did last summer and add a tiny dash of single white female now blend until completely nonsensical there is nothing new to this plot and revisiting the clichs ive grown so fond of wasnt even entertaining this time this movie jumps to and from the past too much and once i made sense of it all i realized it still didnt make much sense characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye speaking of characters they are all your stereotypical favorites the greedy selfish lawyer the egocentric actress the hasbeen baseball star the video voyeur the bitter girl the spooky quiet chick the nicerthannice nice girl a freakin black cat and i didnt care about any of them perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work there were some decent scenes in it but overall this movie was a mess i should also mention a certain video tape that would have been impossible to shoot this movie isnt the worst asian horror has to offer by far but it is still pretty bad if you just want to see some creepy images in the dark or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting or just want to yell youre stupid at a movie screen or just want to have another asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many youve seen this movie is for you those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere,0,0,negative,
manipulative drama about a glamorous model margaux hemingway who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician chris sarandon to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister played by reallife sibling mariel whose music teacher he is while the central courtroom action holds the attention thanks largely to a commanding performance by anne bancroft as hemingways lawyer the film is too often merely glossy but also dramatically unconvincing the jury ostensibly takes the musicians side because a the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together what the f she was clearly tied up what resistance could she realistically offer the second half of the film involving sarandons rape of the sister which curiously anticipates irreversible 2002 by occurring in a tunnel is rather contrived mariels character should have known better than to trust sarandon after what he did to her sister but margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately the climax in which sarandon gets his just desserts with margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante is however a crowdpleaser in the style of death wish 1974 incidentally ubiquitous italian movie mogul dino de laurentiis was behind both filmsits worth noting how the two hemingway sisters lives took wildly different turns this was the film debut of both margauxs career never took off despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here while mariel would soon receive an oscar nomination for woody allens manhattan 1979 and interestingly would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of reallife playboy centerfold dorothy stratten in bob fosses star 80 1983 with the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 chillingly the hemingway family had a history of suicides notably the sisters grandfather celebrated author ernest who died of a selfinflicted gunshot wound in 1961,0,-1,neutral,

i guess if you like snow boarding you may get some enjoyment from watching some nice scenery and some nice tricks but that is all the film has to offer the story line is nonexistent and any jokes that may have been in the film were not funny even on a sympathy level i also disliked the characters the main actor adam grimestried his best and for a comedy like this that doesnt have to be much but when surrounded by so many other bad actors he had no hope of making this film good but i shouldnt be too harsh on them for all i know they might have great skill but with a script that i could have written in ten minutes what ever skills they had were ran and hid for fear of appearing in this film my advise is dont watch it i wish i never did,0,-1,positive,
back in 2004 i saw true tom tykwers contribution to paris je taime when i saw it i loved it and became thrilled it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much of course i wanted to watch the whole film and i would even check who was attached etcyesterday i finally saw it courtesy of the internetfirst of all i must say that it looks awesome the photography is beautiful in every short and shot at the worst being nothing special but still brilliant and clear later i read the trivia here and maybe its how scanning in 6k gives more justice to all the dps work my special favorites are the quais de seine first scene that sunlight the sin cityesquire but better for me quartier de la madeleine and 14th arrondisement but you know what the hell i like them all true or faubourg saintdenis still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours my eyes they tremble and quartier latin is gold imprisoned on silver beautifulyes these are some beautiful short filmsnow lets get onto the content i very much and i mean very much like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt you never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts and i think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts i loved coming from a simple love story into a crazychinesemusicalinpariswithbarbetschroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue i love surprises and this film has them its great they took a chance to let all these directors flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema which i have come to heavily despise its not heavily experimental but i can breath the breathing space these people hadi like the small time and i love the acting i love the simplicity and i love the love i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general its a film that is very very very nice to see alone or with someone to simply feel it left me feeling very goodthere is something about the earnestness in it its so frankwhat i didnt like well for me there are two shorts that arent exactly the best quais de seine which is good natured sure and maybe even necessary but feels too much like a commercial and prelachaise that even though i love the acting i felt its themes were forced but that of course is just me tour eiffel i also didnt love but i think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of sylvain chomet i dont know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actors and directors and so they can delight in their interaction in the surprises look out for alexander payne in a funny role and basically in what will this director do with this great question i enjoyed it very much in that wayi repeat now most shorts i loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix i definitely recommend it definitely so watch it if you like eclectic beautiful love,1,1,positive,
i had very high hopes walking into this movie after all oceans 11 was a truly great hollywood product its rapidfire jokes incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films i have ever seen of course with all the money it made a sequel was on the way and i for one was excitedneedless to say i was absolutely blown away by this movie blown away by how horribly wrong things can go this movie had everything going for it the return of the entire original cast the same director news stories of crazy on and offset antics how could it possibly have gone so wrongit starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there after reasonably goofy short scenes between pittzetajones and clooneyroberts the film spends several minutes watching andy garcia waltz from scene to scene telling each individual member of danny oceans original eleven that he wants his money back believe me when i say that these scenes are only here to pad andy garcias running time because without these ridiculously awkward shots his screen time would be well under five minutesthis leads me to another major qualm i had with this film the pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story and only sometimes brought back later bernie macs character is dropped from the script early on and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue garcia appears for the first few minutes and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning and isnt even mentioned again until theres about 2025 minutes left even clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prisonthis would all be excusable if the film was funny at all 90 of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best the plot is undeniably worthless and left me feeling cheated at one point in the film the team takes on a job worth 25 million of the nearly 100 million they need to raise before garcias twoweek deadline several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is but they do it anyway over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldnt even be doing and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time furthermore the equipment they use to pull this job off clearly cost millions upon millions to fund just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than 25 million to pull off obviously because of this they have to pull off several jobs to make the money the beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off here they pull so many jobs in so many different ways that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours longwe all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end thus is the nature of the caper film the twist at the end of oceans twelve made me laugh not because it was funny but because i couldnt believe how cheated i felt i wont give it away because i know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anywaywhat i will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevanti was excited to see this film after absolutely adoring oceans 11 i left the theater feeling like i had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching i have never given a 1 to a movie on imdbcom but theres a first time for everything consider yourselves warned110,0,1,positive,
i just found the entire 3 dvd set at walmart in the bargain bin for 550 so i thought i would take another look total of 13 hours to watch it all 26 episodes i was born in 1948 and saw most of them on tv in the sixties many independent stations repeated them for many yearsbetter than i expected actually time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of its creators and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the allied fighting men and women more abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary but very truthful in its depiction of the causes and final results of wwii that war was greatly dependent on sea transportation and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the worlds oceans the allies were the ones who were able to do itinteresting too to see how they try to strike a balance between big events and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen the score is impressive if a bit too much by todays standards i read somewhere that robert russell bennett contributed just as much as richard rodgers to final score i imagine that rodgers provided all the major themes and it was up to bennett to fit them to the images great jobshould be seen by every ruler or potential ruler a warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals determination and the supplies to back them up logistics their quality and delivery will determine the eventual victors the allies outproduced and surpassed the material quality of the axis attacked their very source in the process and insured their eventual defeatsorry to see that the producer henry salomon lived a very short life imdbs facts were rather skimpy i have to find out more about him he did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death might have more to say at a later timetrivia i had all 3 lp records made of the background music pretty good overall unfortunately the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one relegating immediately to just novelty status rather than for serious music listening too bad too because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing torpedoes being fired bulldozers planesjust for kids mainlyrsgre,1,1,positive,

i dont doubt that victor mclaglen won his best actor oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the mutiny on the bounty leads of clark gable charles laughton and franchot tone who were all in the same race but the informer is still a fine film because john ford wouldnt have gotten his first best director oscar if it wasnt no split involved in his awardthe movie and the story by liam oflaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish republican army he was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in hes down to his last pence and if he cant get back in wants enough for passage to america theres a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named frankie mcphillip played by wallace ford in a moment of weakness he goes to the black and tan constabulary and informs on mcphillipthe ira is pretty anxious to find out who ratted mcphillip out and theyre pretty certain it was mclaglen he hasnt the wit to really cover his own tracks he does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named peter mulligan played by donald meek he also picks up a hangeron played by jm kerriganthe whole action of the informer takes place in 1922 in dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows making it possibly the first noir thriller had it been done post world war ii the informer would have ranked as a great noir classic like odd man out or the the third man which it bares a lot of resemblance tojohn ford knew this world very well he took some time off during the rebellion and was in ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the ira his real name before having it anglicized was sean ofiernanpreston foster plays the ira commandant dan gallagher in the book gallagher is a harder and meaner man than foster has him here my guess is that john ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest he makes it clear that foster has to eliminate the informer because the black and tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in perilthe ira trial scene is the highlight of the film when foster asks donald meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court meek aint in a position to say no the kings justice and writ does not run here it graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary the british are indeed losing their grip on the populationof course the informer a rather grim story has its john ford touches but rather fewer than you would expect even as mclaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree the ira is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthingthe informer is a tale well told about ireland in a grim and dismal time,1,-1,positive,
if john waters had written and directed house of 1000 corpses after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object the result would probably be something like the blood shed its mildly entertaining for the first half hour but then it slides into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each others genitalia with electric carving knives cutlery and pliers susan adriensen sno cakes is incredibly annoying and terry west elvis bullion is almost as bad in whatever it is hes doing in front of the cameramaybe the best thing about the blood shed is that it wont take most viewers very long to forget about it,0,0,positive,
this is one of the few movies i watched twice in the theatre i really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero esteban trueba he makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption isnt this a rather consoling thoughtwhen i watched it for the first time i thought that after the won election the movie would be over i didnt know the book so boy was i wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come i was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the filmmany people here utterly dislike this movie i cannot understand that one single bit maybe those who read the book first are as often with screen adaptations of novels simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold unseen unexplained but as a movie telling a touching story the story of a family the rise and fall of a man the deep compassion of a woman the strength of love and the insanity of hate and conservatism this movie is simply splendid furthermore the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well especially winona ryder and jeremy ironsso definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for,1,1,positive,

after a dirty shame i never thought that i was going to see another john waters movie that movie was really so bad that i was convinced that all his movies would be like that but when the dvd of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie i decided to give it a try anyway only a couple of days later it was shown on television i taped it out of curiosity and now that ive seen it i can tell you that this pecker sure is a lot better than a dirty shamein this movie we see how a young nobody from baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of new york hes a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby when he keeps his very first exhibition in the shop where he works his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness his photographs are sold for enormous prices but when he sees how his family friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to new york they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him and they do but what they get to see there is a bigger shock than they could ever imagineits not difficult to see why i loved this movie a lot more than a dirty shame the first reason is that this movie has an actual story this movie really has something to say and isnt just intended to shock as many people as possible the fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they dont know what the reality is like isnt just funny its not that far from the truth either i guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it but apparently we are all supposed to like it the second reason why i liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer im not saying that everything that you will see is great but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like edward furlong christina riccioverall this isnt a great movie but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes which never really go too far this is an enjoyable movie it certainly isnt the best comedy ever but i liked it a lot more than a dirty shame i give this movie a 6510,1,1,positive,
this is one of the very worst films clark gable made only parnell was obviously worse it is just so painfully clichd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither gable nor jean harlow should have been proud of makinggable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going to the slammer like the gangster talk she holds out hope that hell do the right thing but he just leaves her thereunknown to either of them gosh that shes in the family way eventually the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending they seemed to have forgotten about gables needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow leonard maltin says the stars are at their best here by what standard best at producing unintended chuckles gimme a breakpsafter saying this my wife thinks leonard maltin is going to find me and kick my butt hmmm however despite my comment i think mr maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet i hope that appeased himupdate2208 because i disliked this film so much the first time especially the ridiculous ending i decided to watch it once again after all sometimes when i watch a film again i like it much more and realize that i was a bit too harsh while that has been the case with several films in recent months i still disliked this filmeven the second time most of it was not because of the first half of the film in the first half harlows character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable but when she was sent to prison it was all clichs until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred the bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumbit just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons i stand by my original review despite all the not helpfuls and think that aside from parnell and possibly polly at the circus it might just be the worst gable film,0,-1,positive,
begotten is no doubt someones attempt at originality but what we have here is art in its most morbid grotesque form so for that begotten has my respect but to be realistic it makes no difference what this abomination is about but for the recordin the ultimate in incoherent horror we begin in an unknown time in an unknown place right off the bat we are plunged into the psychotic nightmare that is begotten a god is seemingly depressed mutilating himself with a razor i mean really trying like hell to end it all it takes a while why wouldnt it after this ultramorbid introduction something is happening something is rising from the corpse say hello to mother earth what does she do well she gives birth to a thing the thing would have probably preferred to stay in the womb but thats life the psychotic nightmare realm of begotten welcomes the thing the only way it knows how the thing along with mother earth is mutilated by unknown hooded assailants with evil intentions being the only clarity available from this point on things drag as theyve never dragged before interesting grim images with a totally decent soundtrack is the high points of the remainder not to give the impression that i dont recommend this evilness because i do but only once and only for people with an appreciation for the dark sidefrom my description it may appear that i dont get begotten trust me i get it and yes begotten is art if ive ever seen it everything in this film regardless of how unrelated it may seem is significant that perhaps is the only thing that makes begotten art with that said most of us require some form of entertainment value and this is coming from someone who enjoyed the chooper probably the most intriguing first five minutes ive seen in a film but lets be realistic the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma that is unless its just meant for some kind of psychedelic purposes in that case never mind but how would one rate such a uniquely boring masterpiece depending on how much your attention span can take it should be either 1 or 10 any other number just wouldnt make a statement it hurts to do this but as far as entertainment value goes begotten just aint it 11,0,0,positive,
watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line the excellent character development and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a wholewithout giving away too much of the plot it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves the story has a prologue about what dancing in japan symbolizes sociologically so it isnt exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the us the film is lighthearted youll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe all of the films characters are taken seriously as they are and none are diminished because of their imperfectionsive been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends it just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance is this synchronous or what i think so because now im really geeked to give it a try watch this wonderful family film small children might not get it but teens certainly would and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and againwhy they would make a remake of shall we dance is a mystery as it is perfect asis,1,1,positive,
this is a superbly imaginative low budget scifi movie from cult director vincenzo natali the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen the film is superbly shot i love the cinematography in this it feels fresh and original plotwise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple scifi stuff morgan sullivan jeremy northam is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp a large technological corporation he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife after his first job things become strange his habits change his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu he takes an instant attraction to however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies sullivan whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a braindead day dream while the speakers drone on the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it they now effectively control what these spies do except for sullivan when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp make sullivan a double agent they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him when a mysterious third party becomes involved the person it is revealed that foster works for sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires the cast are great northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent he brings a great visual aspect to his performance his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact the rest of the cast are also gooddirector natali whose previous film was the cult classic scifi flick cube has a real visual flair he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isnt great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great scifi films it is up there with them the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states 12,1,1,positive,
for a long time this was my favorite of the batman films it had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters catwomen and the penguin along with the alwaysinteresting christopher walken however after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and frankly i now prefer the last batman batman begins with christian balethe good nonetheless this is still the most intriguing of the five latterday batman films the stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the batman movies director tim burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals as this is a great example the three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting almost fascinating of the villains i preferred catwomen finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other batman stories but one is never bored watching this as he did in the first film michael keaton does a fine job playing batmanbruce waynethe bad for a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read i still think these first two batman movies both done by burton were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate although unlike the first movie there was no usage of the lords name in vain in here there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks that would have been okay if they hadnt marketed this film for kids as well as adults danny devitos penguin is downright gross in spots grotesque i can handle but who wants gross few guys meanwhile complained about the beautiful michelle pfeiffer playing catwoman generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on christian bashing also made me reconsider my previouslyhigh rating of this filmoverall fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the batman series but toodark an edge too gross and too much antireligious bias all finally turned me off after a halfdozen looks at this film sorry but i prefer a kindergentler batman movie after all its just a cartoon most will disagree but i was glad to see the series lighten up after this one,1,-1,positive,

this is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting i never tire of watching it i especially love the scene where danny glovers character and kevin klines character namely simon and mack have brunch together kevin kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often so its a very real movie one of the most powerful scenes in the movie however is at the beginning of the movie when simon arrives at the scene where macks car has broken down the movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where theres one person preaching his guts out to an audience instead the actors emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does best without the use of words and lastly mary mcdonell is brilliant as always,1,1,positive,
i was fortunate enough to see the last stop here where i live at the moving pictures film festival for those of you that dont know the moving pictures film festival is a tour of canadian made film in canada i was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an american distribution deal which added to my excitementim a big horror movie fan and yes i love the scream trilogy as well so when i found out that rose mcgowan was doing a ten little indians type of movie i knew that i was in for a treat rose mcgowan was the biggest name actoractress at the entire festivalthe best way i can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that its not quite like scream and it certainly is worth seeing its set in the middle of a snowstorm it was filmed in vancouver bc canada at a mountaintop motel which adds to the suspense rose mcgowan puts in a great performance as thegirlnextdoor along with the rest of the cast and as for what happens at the end well the only thing ill say is that youll never guess the endingsadly it probably wont make it into mainstream north american theatres because the only decent money maker in it is rose mcgowan but if you get the chance to see it i would recommend you do and if worse comes to worst theres always videoi gave it a 9 out of 10,1,-1,positive,

dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography extase is so much more than the erotic drama weve all come to expect this is almost a silent film with what dialogue there is in german and highly simplified german at that perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible european audience as anyone with even a little high school level deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles the story is of little importance anyway with the film succeeding on a cinematic level not a narrative one symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human charactersthere are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star hedy lamarrand there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of dreyer vertov and riefenstahl if the film has any message to convey i think its a political one bourgeois man is timid and impotent working class man is a happy productive creature and woman is the creator destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child this blend of soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogma doesnt overwhelm the film by any meansits a beauty to watch from beginning to endbut it does place it in a very distinct artistic era and oh yeah hedy does get her kit off,1,-1,neutral,

this movie deserves credit for its original approach it combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling unfortunately it falls flat on all levels the films biggest weakness is its unwillingness to commit to anything it has camp moralistic and epic elements without ever committing to any of them as for the story itself chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churlmost likely two types of people will see this francophiles or arthuriophiles speaking as one of the latter i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story,0,0,negative,

besides the comments on the technical merits of the production or lack thereof the acting is absolutely horrible what is really scary about this movie is that i actually own a copy of it of course it was in a bargain bin and had been renamed as dark harvest 2 and after having seen it i can understand why it was in the bargain bin they should have paid me for taking it out of their inventorythe majority of the movie if you want to call it that is spent by a frantic father running around a corn field maze looking for his daughters because he has a premonition that something is going to happen to them i suspect that the camera that the girls were playing with at the beginning of the film was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco in the maze he runs into the ghost of some children which are poorly done and the movie goes horribly south from therei can see why they renamed this movie otherwise they would never have gotten rid of them absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever had to sit through and it wasnt worth the 2 i spent on it,0,0,negative,
as a massive fan of fantasy in general and of the works of neil gaiman in particular ive been looking forward to this film so avidly so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that i can scarcely believe its finally here and you know what i neednt have feared the film version is bldy awesome different from the book but in a good way less whimsical more comical still deeply sweet and enchantingthe special effects are absolutely spoton and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusiveproper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing and the casting in the main is a triumph with the ghostly princes whose rollcall read almost as a whos who of currently cool british comedy rupert everett david walliams of little britain fame two of the blokes from green wing etc stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films funniest moments which exist in abundance in fact the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little ott subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story ricky gervais cameo for example was far too much just ricky gervais doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona for my liking and in my opinion created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story though in fairness from memory i believe the ferdy character in the original book was pretty ricky gervaisesquire when i think back on itbut this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance charlie cox as the protagonist tristan captures the correct mixture of naivety subtle comedy and selfrealisation required for a story like this where a humble young boy embarks on lifechanging quest claire danes as yvaine is beautiful feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal a perfect interpretation of her stellar role robert de niro in the cameo every reviewer is talking about is indeed deserving of praise rollicking good fun looks like hes having a ball too and michelle pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch lamia my favourite performance of the film overall if you enjoyed her deliciously btchy performance in the recent hairspray then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this tooso to round off this review you will laugh for sure you will smile and you may even cry stardust is a beautiful heartwarming fairytale for all the family with a heart of gold and more sass n smarts than is immediately apparent one of my alltime favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride and stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory and just as the princess bride remains fresh smart and funny twenty years after its initial release i believe that the delicious tongueincheek sweetness of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions or equivalent future device for many years to come,1,1,positive,

back in the 1960s those of us who were bad movie aficionados thought that plan nine from outer space was the worst movie ever made and would remain so for all time to put things in perspective though we also thought that 3000 was a lot to pay for a new caras we grew older our innocence was gradually stripped away as we were exposed to movies like hercules in new york and overdrawn at the memory bank which completely redefined the bad movie genre in this context last night my son and i saw alien from la which pushed the envelope to an extreme unimaginable just a generation ago to call this movie bad or wretched or execrable completely fails to do it justice as does any other label existent in the english language even if there were words with which to accurately describe this movie it would be of no consequence since they would be banned in civilized societythe alien referred to in the title is played by kathy ireland who apparently took some time off from modeling swimsuits for sports illustrated to kick off her cinematic career her casting might seem some sort of recommendation until you actually see the movie the makeup artists earned their money by making kathy look so drab and unappetizing you would not want to touch her with the far end of a broomstick no mean feat to put it bluntly in this movie she has a face that would freeze medusa even worse than her look though was her voice which was so raucous that i initially failed to credit it as originating with a human being throughout the movie i found myself longing for a chalkboard to drag my nails across to cover the screechy twang of her dialog at the end of the movie kathy finally gets a makeover and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit i suggested to my son that the movie would have been better if they had put her in the swimsuit at the beginning of the movie so at least we would have had something to watch my son perceptively pointed out that if they had then removed the swimsuit and stuffed it into her mouth it would have considerably improved the movie on two counts i defer to the plain brilliance of his observation if you have any doubts compare this dreck to barbarella in which a competent filmmaker shows how to exploit the assets of an ethereally beautiful leading lady in the fantasy genreof the plot itself there is little on which to comment since there was so little in evidence it is said that if a million monkeys typed unceasingly for millions of years eventually one would come up with hamlet by the process of elimination the rest of the time they would come up with something approximating this screenplay imagine if you will a modernday alice falling into a hole and dropping 500 feet onto a rock slab following which she gets up dusts herself off and starts looking for her longlost father in the citykingdom of atlantis once in atlantis she spends most of her time running fighting or climbing stairs and ladders and basically trying to keep out of the hands of a general who seems to have no soldiers to do his bidding and who would make tiny tim look macho this summation as abbreviated as it appears is probably longer than the shooting scripton the plus side as you revel in the production values and take in whatever you can of the sets and costumes through the smoke and haze you realize that this is one movie in which you can actually see on the screen where all 20 of the budget wentthe thought that kept going through my mind was that filmmakers ought not be given access to drugs and alcohol while they are shooting a movie or perhaps prior if it leads to results like alien from la though in fairness i have to acknowledge that i dont know whether they were actually involved in substance abuse or were simply brain dead at the outset of the project,0,0,positive,

this is indeed a god adaptation of jane austens novel compared with the american version with guinneth paltrow the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book but the acting was awful besides kate beckinsale who i believe was a true likeness of the emma in the book all the other actors were trying too hard mark strong was not the gentleman he was supposed to be he was often rude and offensive had no feeling whatsoever and throughout the entire film you could not see his love growing for emma at all this had a terrible effect on kate beckinsale who seemed to be trying to resque her leading role as well as her partners moreover there was no chemistry between the entire cast hariett smith played by samantha morton seemed to have no real attachment to mr elton played by dominic rowan therefore she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book the settings of the film are also too poor the costumes are even more so i would have imagined emma woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here the ending is also too long it is good that it resembles the books ending but it is a killer ending for a film and again i can see no feeling of happiness in the face of mrknightley to conclude i believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book but with poor actors it seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all i would prefer to see the lighter version with paltrow and northam even if it is clear that it was made to be a blockbuster than to watch these actors excepting the good olivia williams and the better kate beckinsale ruin the entire script,0,0,positive,
one thing i can say about this movie is well long very long i actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out i was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because the 70s even though i never lived in them is actually one of my favourite decades especially for the music when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive i will admitt the animation did impress me it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see but the movie honestly could of been a bit better it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly in my opinion i thought it was extremely long i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie it made it seem like it was 4 hours long but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those nothing to do days i will see the new one and i hope it is better,1,0,negative,
i watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 melbourne international film festival and noone had a good word for iti happen to love bluegrass and country music so its not as if im unsympathetic to the subject matter but the problem is that at heart its a very conservative movie little more than a filmed mills and boon story a bodiceripper of the most simpleminded and soppy kindits not just that the love story at its heart that between reece and dr lily penleric is more than a tad unbelievable why any male would be attracted to the nostrilflaring mandevouring lily is beyond me and frankly mike harding as reece seems to be just going through the motionsits simply that the whole movie is too tame and wellmannered for its own good there is precious little danger dirt or drama sure theres a moment of excitement involving a school run by lilys younger sister but this whole episode is funnier than it is dramatic its just so poorly written and acted and the movie betrays its conservative agenda in the manner in which this subplot is resolvedas for good old reece kinkaid now whats wrong with a name like eberneezer bumpass i ask you is the ending of this film believable fitting in with the character this film had earlier constructed i think not,0,0,positive,

the twins effect chinese actioncomedy charlene choi gillian chungthis vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the very fact that i was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie first of all the characters are memorable contributing a myriad of classic scenes charlene and gillian are naturally cute charismatic and humorous this movie was my first exposure to them and all i wanted to do was reach through my television screen and give them a really big hug the remaining cast did well in their supporting roles including jackie chan karen mok the duke josie ho edison chen anthony wong and the vampire bad guys one of which looks eerily familiar to will ferrell even the abominably horrible ekin cheng was good in this one good characters are important of course because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequencesand speaking of action this film has plenty of it more importantly there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography one aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonists a sword with a retractable spearended rope this weapon in and of itself opened up a variety of moves that would have been otherwise impossible josie ho and gillian chung in particular perform some wicked aerial maneuvers using these devices in addition the swordplay is superb and is highlighted by two great sword fights one taking place during the opening train station sequence and the other occurring in the church finale in fact the bladewielding maneuvers showcased in this film put some other highly overrated fan favorites to great shame and i truly feel sorry for those who would cite the horribly choreographed garbage seen in ashes of time storm riders or a man called hero with the wellplanned precisely executed sequences seen in the twins effect its not even close i cant understand why this film gets so much criticism im sure diehard apologists for the hong kong golden age will hate this because it doesnt fit into their narrowminded view of what hong kong action should be we should learn from the downfall of john woo a one trick pony who never learned how to reinvent himself we dont need another clone we need something different the twins effect is one good examplethis film was so good that it actually set me up for being disappointed at other chinese movies with the same actors and actresses this especially applies to ekin cheng whose other films almost always suck and yes this includes the obscenely overrated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph even the twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when both were lead actresses in a film although they have managed to hit some good films when either one or the other takes the leading role eg beyond our ken good times bed times house of fury or when one or both are in supporting roles eg colour of the truth new police story just one look the twins effect 2 should have been a direct sequel instead of a family fantasy i am still yearning to see charlene and gillian team up and kick some butt in another movie but the fact remains that the twins effect hits on all cylinders optimizing their charisma while avoiding a descent into annoyance as in protg de la rose noireall in all this film has everything one needs to be entertained and may i remind the reader that it is precisely this entertainment that judges the greatness of a movie more so than artsy dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking aboutin the end the twins effect is a classic not to be missedrating 55 stars ps the hollywood execs decided to slaughter this film when it was released in the us by renaming it the vampire effect and cutting out 20 minutes of footage which includes parts of the action scenes however the final fight of the us version does have a better soundtrack than the original version therefore i purchased both versions which allows me to first watch the original until about the 120 mark and then swap discs to watch the final fight on the us version,1,-1,positive,

okay i marked this spoiler so dont be upset when i wrap this up now i went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie and i was right as almost every horror flick i have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most what helped was the story i did not expect there to be a why to kanes madness but there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for but if your a fan of saw or some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content this is a movie to watch now where i really throw in a spoiler for a second warning i give this movie a 9 perhaps because im a fan of the wwe and a fan of kane but who doesnt like a movie a little bit better when it stars somebody we love however this movie could have scored a 10 for me if spoiler at the end of the movie when it showed kane dead on the pavement while a dog pissing in his eye was cute it could have been classic with the kaneundertaker quick sit up and turn of the head a perfect 10 would have been awarded if that would have happened it was a perfect opportunity but either the wwe didnt think of that or a future sequel will begin with that very sequence i mentioned thats all 9,1,0,positive,

kenneth branagh attempts to turn william shakspeares obscure rarelyproduced comedy into a 1930sera musical with the result being both bad shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both particularly painful is nathan lane who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as costard but is badly mistaken and alicia silverstone who handles the shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged valley girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school english classthe musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of dames at sea leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing with the lone exception being adrian lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man the only other saving grace of the film are natascha mcelhone and emily mortimers contribution as eye candy but they have given far better performances than in this film and youd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass,0,0,negative,

the third installment of the carnosaur trilogy features a bunch of keystone kopsquality military commandos trying to kill two velociraptors and a trex i give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy it really cant be taken seriously more significantly however watching this movie i cant help but notice some interesting parallels between the carnosaur and xtro trilogies the first installment in both franchises is a dark disturbing film that has become a cult classic the second is an alien ripoff and the third is a tongueincheek almost slapstick whether intentional or not movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing also like the xtro franchise all the carnosaur movies are completely unrelated to one another they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the sequels i guess obviously carnosaur and xtro have two different production groups at work here but if youve seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two,0,0,negative,
after a lively if predictable opening bankheist scene set it off plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink this is a movie that deals in nasty threadbare stereotypes instead of characters preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought wit or feeling in short its no different from 90 of hollywood product but its the racial angle that makes set it off a particularly saddening example of contemporary filmmaking posing as a celebration of sistahood the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating aficanamerican gangsta stereotype the gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all african americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the man it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else worse set it off exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure serious racerelated social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery then theyre ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished the lapd turns out to be a bunch of caring guiltridden liberals tell that to rodney king and aspirational good sista jada pinkett smith follows the path of upward mobility out of the hood and into a world of middleclass selfindulgence opened up for her by her buppie bankmanager boyfriend set it off illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the hood while all the time despising it while the likes of shaft and superfly in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed wellworn plots they had a freshness an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch set it off wouldnt be worth getting angry over if wasnt a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of africanamerican filmmaking since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s,0,-1,neutral,
a good entertainment but nothing more in this western we are between the classics and the spaghetti ones this provides us a good a conventional story but its always a pleasure to see robert mitchum with his legendary flegma although he isnt as fit as in the forties or the fifties and dont forget david carradine is the son of john carradine,1,-1,neutral,
this is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night if you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you the makings of a real cult classic it has everything you would want to see in a horror movie a beautiful girl a hero the buffoon a monster truck and of course a family of mutant satanic killers this one is full of bloodguts and gore i strongly recommend watching this one in the wee early morning hours and be careful of who sees you being entertained by the sounds of monster trucks bad but funny one liners and our hero eating eye ball stew not as good as the evil dead but a close second just remember warning do not eat before viewing this film,1,0,positive,

la lupa mannara aka werewolf woman of 1976 is a film with a highly promising title but sadly the film itself is pretty far away from being a mustsee for my fellow italian horror buffs you wont hear me say that rino di silvestris film is entirely bad it has its stylish moments and the first half is actually great fun to watch though the fun is unintentional the film also profits from an exceptionally exhibitionist leading actress annik borel however the film which has no real plot at least no linear one often makes no sense at all and it drags incredibly throughout the mostly superfluous second halfdaniella annik borel has strange dreams about a dancing around naked in the night before turning into a werewolf woman since she was a raped as a girl daniella is afraid of men then when her sister cult siren dagmar lassander comes to visit with her husband daniella suddenly feels attracted to the husband and subsequently turns into a werewolf woman herself or something the storyline really doesnt make the slightest sense which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half the leading character daniella is some schizophrenic mixture of frigid hysteric and lusty nymphomaniac who occasionally turns into a werewolf woman director di silvestri chose to make up for the plotholes with a lot of of female nudity which works fine for me there are also some pretty welldone gore moments the film is never even slightly suspenseful or creepy but it is very entertaining in the beginning also there are no attempts to hide that this is a slice of sleaze the camera often does closeups on the miss borels private parts for the simple heck of it im not complaining then for some reason di silvestri chose to make the film longer by completely changing the direction in which it was going while daniella is at first a typical werewolf who cannot help but follow the urges of her curse this suddenly changes when she meets a guy howard ross who was in fernando di leos il boss of 1973 suddenly she goes back to normal again and the subsequent part of the film does not at all go in hand with the first half it gets pretty damn boring after a while all things considered it probably would have been better for this 99 minute film to be only 70 minutes long at the end they even want to make us believe that the absurd story if one can call it that is based on true events werewolf woman has some redeeming qualities my fellow italohorror fans can give it a try however if you wanna watch italian horrorexploitation cinema from the 70s there are hundreds of films that you should see before seeing this one,0,0,positive,
this movie is horrendous decent fight scenes or not the acting is really bad like you can tell theyre reading their lines from a card with painful line delivery by everyone in the cast think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actors interactions weird pauses between different characters lines combined with hurried line delivery by others if the movie were all action this might be forgivable but a lot of the movie includes plot setup and family guy style irreverent cut aways oh wow are they badly done im assuming they were attempting to be funny with these but it again came off as a bunch of highschoolers college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny youtube clip now to the fight scenes theyre not too bad considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film nothing great either certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated nothing like drunken master the fights have an overly staged feel with lots of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved in sum the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guys friends involved with this very very cheap production which guy you may ask oh the same guy who wrote directed produced and stared in this middle school masterpiece,0,-1,positive,
if i look hard enough flaws can be found in this film primarily with the script i found the character of wolf not totally convincing however those were my only complaints because when this movie started on cable i was just going to record it and watch it later however from the beginning with the eerie music and cameron diaz doing her spaced out 60s dance i was riveted i never got up until the movie was over it seemed like i never even blinkedthe acting of cameron diaz and jordana brewster was excellent the scenes were beautiful the girls were beautiful and the music was haunting and very touching the story was quite unique and at times had a surreal quality the viewer would tend to like the picture more if they had a good understanding of the state of mind of young people in the 60s and 70s especially in america many of the scenes basically succeeded in showing something of that era that is hard to pin down it was a bit more complicated than the simplistic statement that they wanted to change the world and ended up disillusioned although that may be the most obvious aspect phoebe learns more and more about this as the movie progressesone aspect that didnt seem to be covered by the other reviewers that might bear mentioning is the way the two daughters seem to drift through life after the death of their father they both had adored him and his presence had been a stabilizing factor in their lives and obviously he had loved them dearly we read so much today about boys who lose their fathers too soon only to lose their way themselves this film covers the ripple effect of the loss of the father on the daughters left behind first on the older sister faith then on to her younger sister their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents this type of dynamic is not covered in hardly any other movies especially in so many different layers of plot and subplot phoebes inner struggles of reality versus perceptions are gradually peeled away like layers of an onionspeaking of plot this movie should rate higher than it has here i kept waiting for some great conspiracy to be found out concerning the death of faith how it did resolve itself surprised me even if others may have guessed much soonermaybe not for everybody but i could watch this movie many many times,1,1,positive,
as to be expected theres a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the alwayspopular premise of zombies and starring the 80s bmovie queen linda blair namely it sucks the chilling is trying enormously hard way too hard to be a story with depth and factual background whereas it should have just been a lightheaded and gorepacked horror flick about frozen zombies it takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens theres a lot of drivel about cryogenics which i learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures so naturally in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen needless to say this is extremely boring until two dimwitted night watchmen decide during an electric power failure that its a good idea to put the metalconstructed cool cells outside at the heights of a thunderstorm the coolers are struck by lightening obviously and the bodies spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage the chilling is a boring and surprisingly for a late 80s effort at least gorefree horror film that doesnt even use up a quarter of its potential all the painful attempts to build up an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and i cant think of any reason why the zombieattacks had to be so bloodless even in spite of the low budget available they could have done better the set pieces makeup effects and costumes are pitiable the research lab for example looks like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombies couldnt look less menacing with their green faces and foilwrapped outfits how linda blair managed to get involved yet again in such an embarrassing lowbudgeted horror flick is a complete mystery shes attracted to lousy bmovies like bees are to honey,0,0,negative,
what are people on here talking about i must have seen a different movie than you guys i was so bored that i walked out of the theater what is up with this stuff i only laughed once and not even that hard whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten i usually always find something i like in a movie but this is crazy slackers makes not another teen movie look like a classic it ranks up there with such trash as body shots con air and conspiracy theory as one of the worst of all time avoid at all costs i thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies but to my dismay that wasnt happening looks like i will never see that money again or the two hours,0,0,negative,
so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless i know it got awards and things but i personally did not enjoy it too much there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs some of the people in are rather different which isnt a bad thing it just didnt leave a good impression on me i was thoroughly bored by this movie no offense to my creative writing teacher the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didnt get it and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing the green animals thing was neat i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers but how did these four jobs connect it just didnt make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that but if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it who am i to stand in your way i am just forewarning you about possible suffering,0,0,negative,

in case half of this films footage looks strangely familiar it means you watch way too much of this gory italian cultcrap for you see the notorious demigod lucio fulci did not only produce this movie he also took the liberty of reusing the most sadistic killing sequences in his own and more easily traceable cat in the brain the opening scene already in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe features in fulcis later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments andrea bianchis masssacre fails miserably as a giallo since the search for the sadistic killer among a moviecrew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful but its still good entertainment if youre into cheap n shlocky horror trash the incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters whore all potential maniacs but none of the red herrings biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous makeup effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast whenever there isnt any bloodshed on screen like between the first and second murder massacre is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography thankfully in the second half there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes the music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative my advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned cat in the brain that one features all the great moments of massacre and then some,0,-1,positive,

enterprise the latest high budget spinoff to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90minute episode called broken bow first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban who are the main enemy in the first season of the show from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is with some of the best character development story and actionvisual effects ever seen in such a short amount of timethe openingcredits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans whom some believe that the song is out of place what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves if one listens to the actual song instead of the theme then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together and eventually as the series progresses further and further and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew will the song actually become meaningful overall diane warrens theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watsonwhat makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered enterprise is in my opinion one of the most well cast shows since the next generation choosing scott bakula as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jeanluc picard as the captain always leads the show bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins he simply is both actor wise and character wise a superb human being and his charm wit and compassion are overwhelming to watch as for the other cast members a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr phlox its also nice to see a nonhuman playing a role and the decision to give the captain a dog named porthos was a wellreceived idea throughout the show character development was brilliant it was fast well timed and almost perfect i say almost because sadly travis mayweathers character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season he does have some things to say here and there but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander tpol dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer connor trinneer plays commander charles trip tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting all of these characters make up enterprise and all bring a quality that star trek hasnt seen in a long time each person makes this show worth watching smiles and feelgood senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx01the ship itself the nx01 is somewhat questionable in design the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships namely the akira class starship continuity has been an issue in enterprise but thankfully rick berman and brannon braga offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details if you see the show with and open mind then youll have no problems but there is an urge to know why all the time so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fanbase with the issue of the deign of the ship itself according to them the nx01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact when zefram cochrane saw the enterprisee through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker it changed the ideas in his head thats a good enough explanation for melets move on of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer come on guys grow upwhen george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy fans couldnt do anything only watch and sap it all up anyway and then they learned that well maybe its not that bad after all if you cant accept a quality show for what it is not what it should be in your mind then go elsewhere or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can dothe sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise aka flagship of the american fleet like it so much they are striking sets and represent the show perfectlyrick berman the overlord of the empire as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have and in all the right places whether that be technicalities visuals sound editing or score enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be when in the hands of geniuses the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan so should you,1,1,positive,
the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the daythis would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft windowi am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problemah a response trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data id say is a charming but weak and gullible argument what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by us government that the moonmissions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe things are nearly never quite what they seem just watch the movie and i dear say youll see things a bit different than beforefirst off weather data doesnt come from nasa it comes for met agencies around the world second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims,0,-1,neutral,
i did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a welles box set i had recently purchased a box set i chiefly got because i wanted to own a man for all seasons and to also reevaluate waterloo so i stick orson and rita in the player and im treated to class and confusion in equal measureon the surface the story seemed a simple one man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband and thenwell it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans michael ohara orson welles himself doesnt really know what is going on he is as confused as the viewer is and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as elsa bannister rita hayworth has its moments but you just know that things are going to go pear shapedso many wonderful things in the film it has welles visual style all over it see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye the narration from ohara is joyously self mocking and we get good light relief by way of a court case with everett sloane considerably lighting up proceedingsyet the film is an oddity and in fact its a choppy viewing experience because as i was to find out after studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer but unfair on welles vision im positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale as it is tho we have a very good and intriguing film one that sadly only hints at greatness but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that im glad i own to revisit further 8510,1,1,positive,
unfortunately jean eustache 19381981 belongs like so many once leading french film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international dvds since we have a good oldfashioned videostore in tucson i had the chance to watch this 3 12hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten secondssince we speak here about one of the most discussed and most controversially discussed movies of all times let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs originally typical for the early nouvelle vague of a jacques rivette or alain resnais appear almost ridiculous in this movie the dialogs are basically monologues mainly the longest ones spoken by jeanpierre laud the most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people is almost zero laud or his character alexandre pleases to tell more about himself than about the topics he is seemingly to speak therefore one can hardly speak about communication in this movie it is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas but the type of man alexandre exists to all times we find him already in petrons satiricon which work has actually great resemblance with the mother and the whorealexandre does not only nothing but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is he mocks at the people who run to work at 7 cclock in the morning when he is just busy having his last drink before he goes to bed in the apartment of one of his girlfriends from whose money he lives he is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between nietzsche and bernanos especially sartre who is shown quickly in the french intellectual caf aux deux magots where alexandre too is sitting all day must serve as excuse for the lifestyle of alexandre and his colleagues because they suffer existential crisis from bourgeois nausea however the intellectual speeches of alexandre seem to be rather pseudointellectual and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective booksit is true this movie demands an extremely broad european knowledge especially the connoisseurship of french existentialist philosophy and there consequences to the 68 student revolution movement but if you have this knowledge than you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life by staring amazed into the tv and crying out with laughing like you have probably not done it since a long time,1,-1,positive,

i watched this movie to the end and that was really not easy it is so boring bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from blair witch project that you cant believe the makers take this serious even harder to believe is how this product made it onto vhs and dvdso if want to see a horrormovie just watch scream but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability watch dark area,0,0,negative,
i never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused especially in french and the neighboring countries in belgium where i am located for example baisemoi was announced as the most shocking and the most thoughtprovoking social drama you could ever experience yeah right it might be a little shocking maybe how often do you see someone getting shot up the arse but the weak and pointless plot surely didnt cause me to think much baisemoi is another one of those blame everything that goes wrong on societyfilms and theyre generally not very convincing about 99 of the people functions perfectly well in this society so why would you blame this exact same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged nymphgirls the two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flashes nadine just killed her roommate manu shot her brother and the two meet in an abandoned trainstation late at night they decide to travel around france together leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop although were constantly exposed to pornography and violence this film is very boring to sit through like the girls are indicating themselves all the time the dialogues are lame and the people they run into and kill are very uninteresting if people want to make porno movies thats fine by me but please dont pretend that its arthouse filmmaking if you leave out the swearing and the hip camerawork all there is to see is not so arousing pornography cool soundtrack though,0,0,positive,
the first half of this film held some promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a lowkey character psychodrama like the minus man but then the whole thing collapses into cliche and the viewer slowly loses all interest theres a decent cast here but the film is lifeless and the talent completely wasted,0,-1,neutral,

a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title it draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of hollywoodlike falseness that glorifies things that shouldnt be glorified im not sure i agree with the filmmakers take on recent events although truthfully i cant always tell exactly where he stands but i admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across audio tracks of speeches radio interviews poetry etc play as large a role here as visuals most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect im kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie in fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another thats not to say that there arent characters real people but except for jim the protagonist a kind of 60s drop out with an erratic state of mind the others come and go pretty quickly a few make a very powerful impression especially a gurulike taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself when he breaks out into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving jim to the subway it is a very powerful moment on the cover of the dvd is the quote the danger is clear which is taken from president bushs speech that paved the way to our incursion into iraq in retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered,1,-1,neutral,
naruto the anime tv series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies and a third one is coming our way this summerthe first one which was released in the summer 04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of naruto in an exciting adventure however one must be a blind deaf and one legged chicken to deny that films faults whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable there were a lot of things that could be improved on naruto movie 2 however takes all of these aspects and excels upon themthe action first of all was incredibly cinematic the lighting setting and style was three fold as effective as in the first movie in the first we were given basic action well animated and choreographed animation but nothing eye popping however this movies cinematography was exceptional the use of shadows and lighting combining together to make the action all that more intense was very effective and added to the force of the fightingthe animation was very good it rivalled disney however since this is a movie about tv characters there was nothing exceptionable about the character design or detail to the actual characters however the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic i think they even used twice the amount of cels for each second because there was absolutely nothing jittery about the animation at all it was incredibly fluidthe music i think thats where this movie fails the original composerconductor for the tv show was used for the film and i dont really feel that he did that good of a job the music mostly reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old snes games the composer is very good but the synthesisers used for the film couldnt convey the tune very well however they didnt fail the film at all adding as a good accompaniment to the action but except for a few violinstring pieces towards the end and some choral work the music didnt excel any boundaries or act as anything specialthe story was fun it was a reasonably typical storyline for naruto and was very similar to the first movies except again it took everything that had been wrong with the first films story and improved upon them the characters were a lot more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the entire film it kept making you think the film would be ending any second now but then it would move on but instead of feeling dragged out the action and characters made everything still feel fresh and excitingoverall this film is a goodun but however good it might be it is most definitely one for the fans i enjoyed the film but thats because im a fan but i can see just like with final fantasys advent children it doesnt excel as a movie but merely acts as a fantastic serve of fan service for a good hour and a half though i think this film does act as a good introduction to the series for current nonwatchers it wont give a full effect for anyone other than those glued to naruto screens however despite all this it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of upsetting fillers,1,1,positive,

ill be honest with yall i was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on abc i didnt think i would like it at all but with john ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it plus their was something else with it i liked the acting was great not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines john ritter always brings his a game when it comes to comedy this was a great show to watch and ill tell you why it was a great show my father who never watches sitcoms at all he just watches movies sports and law order he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters my mother and myself and watched the show i think because john ritter was in it i honestly think this show would still be running if john ritter god rest his soul i wish he hadnt passed away,1,-1,positive,

winchester 73 was the film that moved mann from the bmovies to the big league rescuing james stewarts floundering postwar career in the process by casting him as a conflicted hero although since he inherited the project from fritz lang maybe lang deserves the credit for that both men would go to much darker places mann with the remarkably bleak devils doorway which remained shelved by mgm until the success of broken arrow convinced them to release it but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the rifle of the title is handed from person to person along the trail before it ends up in one of the directors beloved mountainside shootouts is still stronger meat than youd expect from the studio system great dialogue an impressive supporting cast dan duryea will geer millard mitchell stephen mcnally shelley winters charles drake tim mcintire jay c flippen tony curtis rock hudson among them and manns outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one,1,1,positive,

theres nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience insteadits only my opinion but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable intelligent characters as far as likability is concerned the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple nicely done unfortunately they are stupid beyond belief let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker1 after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you be sure to tell him what hotel youre staying at when you drop him off2 beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses thereby allowing him to press charges of assault3 dont bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume for no apparently good reason that the cops were bribed by him4 while trying to escape let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her5 after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him oneonone no point in being unfair right now id never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that its effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety since they are victims of their own doing this kills the enjoyability of the entire film in case you were wondering the scriptwriters didnt stop with dimwitted characters since they themselves are surely dimwitted for writing this crapfest they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window1 the stalker kills a cop inside a police station while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away2 the stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior3 the stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being4 the suspense scenes had no imagination whatsoever in fact some scenes were direct ripoffs from american moviesthe only positive is the decapitation near the end which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife its too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left fieldtruly the koreans behind the making of say yes should be ashamed of themselves better yet they should just move to california and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence,0,0,negative,

this is one of the best tv productions of a musical ever i have heard the merman cast album the angela lansbury album i have seen tyne daly live and ive seen the rosalind russell movie countless times i think bette is if not the best then tied with the best she captures not just the bravura but also the pathos of mama rose i was never a natalie wood fan so i really enjoyed cynthia gibb in what is arguably her best role everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful the three strippers led by the alwaysdependable christine ebersole are hard to top there was supposed to be a tv production of mame a few years back with cher but i think bette would be the best bet pun intended for auntie mame,1,1,positive,
i initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of silent hillbeing a huge silent hill fan and disappointed with its movie debut i thought i would give this one a chance mind fearnet only lists this movie as dark floors not by its full name so when i saw the name mr lordi in the credits i immediately thought of the band i had a few friends in college that like them but didnt think it was important and quickly pushed the thought asidethe film starts out strong despite the fact creepy little girl has been done to death the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together the tense atmosphere built rapidly and every indication pointed to the film being excellent as monsters are the true stars of horror i couldnt wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped inand then the first monster showed up and i found myself greatly underwhelmed by the time the second appeared i boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a megadeth concert and the silliness turned me off completelyover the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact and the story left you wondering just what was going on but the scares were pretty much nonexistent however i held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile unfortunately that was not to be the case by the time the movie had reached its climax i was in utter disbelief and i immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal the lead singer of lordi seriously was that what the movie all boiled down to a bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by lordi band members the silly monster design suddenly made sense if youre going to be that corny may as well through the members of marilyn manson or even kiss in there too not to mention the fact that im pretty sure i saw the ending in one of lordis music videos a few years ago they had to go and make an entire movie off of it worst of all when i found out what really had been going on all i could manage was a yawn im not going to ruin it for you but i can safely say its probably a plot device youve seen before most likely more then onceso unless youre a huge lordi fan stay away from this its not scary it doesnt bring anything new to the table although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies mainly silent hill and i cant stress this enough lordi is the antagonist lordi talk about a buzzkill really youd be better off trying to scare yourself watching slipknot music videos in other words its just not possible,0,0,positive,
this is probably the most uninvolving film ive ever seen i watched it because i have a soft spot for leon everything else besson has done has been just awful in my opinion with the exception of the script for wasabi and jean reno its a testament to just how bad this film is that reno one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable actors admittedly hes just starting out here cant make this film or the moments in which he is on screen watchableits all very filmschooly black and white no dialogue people doing things for no apparent reason people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera and predictably none of it is entertainingits not a french mad max as some people have claimed actually i think they mean mad max 2 that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a postapocalyptic setting and is just the kind of comment youd expect from someone who doesnt know what theyre talking about mad max 2 was pulsating mad max 2 was exciting mad max 2 was worth your time le dernier combat is none of thesei know its supposed to be cool to like arty blackandwhite french films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy which is why i wouldnt trust anyone who claims to like le dernier combat because i see nothing of worth in it whatsoever it asks for so much and gives nothing back i found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention anyone who can sit through it undistracted isnt human or at the very most is psychotic actually theyre probably just trying to seem cool,0,0,negative,

ive got a question for those who thought of this idea why what made them think to make a second movie of this if memory serves didnt cinderella end with they all lived happily ever after im pretty sure it did or it was implied wait a minute if they all lived happily ever after how could there be a sequel unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history there couldnt be a sequel i mean sure they could have cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours but why a movie that ends in happily ever after can not have a sequel if it does then they dont live happily ever after somethings got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending why thats not right its evil thats my final word on the matter,0,0,negative,
i may very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film i also saw this movie when it came out and i agree with the last post that up the acedemy was way ahead of its time the humor in the film itself is pure mad magazine i dont see why mad stand behind this feature it was also one of the few films of the early 80s to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from la at the time i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day what can i say there are definitely worst movies out there i dont consider porkys to be as funny as up the academy there are some really good laughs throughout the film and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid hey nobody said this was going to be the maltese falcon,1,0,negative,
this was a shockingly bad movie and i literally gasped the first time seeing the blue screen puppets imagine the worst blue screen special effects you ever saw make it somehow far worse and then combine this with poorly made rubber and playdoh puppets that look like something from a semiretarded preschool art class then add some screeching yngwie malmsteinesquire melodicmetal guitar solos stuff that is way too loud and lasts way too long the overall film is absolutely awful and makes feeders look like rashomon its one of the worst movies ive ever seen with every quantifiable metric spiraling dismally downward much like a waterlogged turd in the perpetual slow whirlpool of a broken rest stop toilet still though a film like actium maximus is not to be missed by the bad movie conesseuirs out there even if only by looking up clips on youtube or someplace this movie is a bit of an eye opener if you can stomach the ride i think this director may be mentally ill though which is a bit debasing watching him discuss the project you get the sense that he truly believes that hes created something wonderful i guess hes the star wars kid of gonzo filmmakers what a mess,0,0,positive,

i dont really know what it is about dirty dancing there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie i cannot possibly recount the hundreds yes hundredsof times ive watched it beginning to end but every time i do come upon it on tv i am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there i am for two hours loving the movie as if im watching it for the first time although patrick swayze and jennifer grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more to see this passion and commitment and i cant help tearing up a tiny bit at the end when patrick comes up to the houseman family and tells her dad nobody puts baby in a corner classic moment for all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy maybe in a way it is but it was the penicle of the 80s films and put patrick swayze right on the map his performance was immaculate three cheers for dirty dancing ps the soundtrack is fantastic an absolute masterpiece,1,1,positive,

when you see barry corbin in the cast of a movie you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash guess which category solo falls into apparently derived from a popular scifi novel weapon solo stars mario van peebles as a humanlooking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination he hides out in a mexican village obviously to save money on locations and extras paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars i suspect william sadler is along for the ride as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy van peebles van peebles manages to beat them all with ease of course while corbin watches all this with bemusement from afar the movie is a horrible ripoff of the the terminator and cyborg series and apparently has little to do with its source material it is horribly written and acted and the big fight at the end if downright comical van peebles a decent actor elsewhere is a scream as he pretends to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh he looks like he is doing the robot dance most of the time,0,0,negative,
from the upper shelf of great classic books comes this masterful story written by pearl buck the book like the movie is called the good earth it relates the story of wang lung paul muni a simple chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the great house where he has taken a slave woman called olan luise rainer and made her his wife almost from the beginning she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home during the following years olan proves her worth by steadfastly sharing her husbands toil troubles and changing fortunes through the passing years they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and famine indeed its at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of companionship loyalty and love with the changing times their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives like their uncle walter connolly who is a scoundrel and charlatan but is compassionately tolerated wang has his old father charley grapewin to advise and remind him of lifes fragile and fickle nature two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are keye luke who plays wangs elder son and phillip ahn who plays a nationalist soldier the film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel highly recommended for all audiences,1,1,positive,
when rodney dangerfield is on a roll hes hilarious in my 5 wives hes not on a roll the timing of the oneliners is off but theyre the best thing going for the movie the five women who play the wives dont add up to one whole actress between them the plot is very weak even the premise is pretty weak there are a few jokes about having multiple wives but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie most of the movie could play the same way even if rodneys character had only one wife so the premise seems more like an old mans fantasy than a key part of the comedy another old mans fantasy were supposed to accept that rodneys character is an athletic skierjerry stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for workthe odd nods to political correctness later in the movie dont really do anything for the movie for those who like their movies politically correct the nonpc humor is still there in the first place and the seeming apologies for it still dont get the point for those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness the pc addins are just annoying digressionsthis has to be the mildest rrated movie ive ever seen there are some racy jokes and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking tv 40 years ago but thats about it maybe it was the topless men kiddingthe dvd features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles i kept wondering if they were serious or kidding they seem to be serious but i kept thinking they must be kidding theres also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the mormons or the church of latterday saints that somehow its not about them never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in utah and makes reference to brigham youngin short my 5 wives was a disappointment i was hoping for rodney on a roll but the best i can say for the movie is that rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time,0,-1,positive,

im sure some people will enjoy it and find it powerful or have some sort of personal connection with the characters and story but from an unbiased stand point its not very well done the film revolves around atypical angstridden teenagers each one playing out a different stereotype making us believe this is what its like to be a teenager we get to see a bit of each teenagers lifestyle but the entire project just came off as pretentious to me whether it be the constant low angle shots of tree branches in the wind or the black and white interviews with the students there was nothing new or original showcased in this movie and nothing i needed to see yes it deals with some strong subject material and the dramatic scenes are played and acted well but the entire project seems unnecessary especially when it seems almost an exact replica to van sants elephant one dealing with suicide the other with a school shooting as i said some people will probably enjoy this and the directorwriter clearly had some sort of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close one so its nice the movie was made with some heart in it but i feel its incredibly ineffective and when dealing with material that can be so easily clichd to do something original with it i would not recommend this movie,0,-1,neutral,

this movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress his head is chopped off and buried separately of his bodysounds like the thing that wouldnt die doesnt it well it does play out a little like that but once the body is reunited with the head all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly i mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and i kept thinking when is it going to end the characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid the villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery the only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track still i want to see a horror movie not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable and dont read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town there isntonly a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless so for the most part i say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap,0,0,negative,
everyone has their choice for worst movie theyve ever seen some like to pick on gigli or battlefield earth some pick on classics like plan 9 from outer space ever since i was 14 i have been very vocal in saying that to me it is problem child 2 and 9 years later i feel the exact same way its not one of the worst its not just an expression it is the actual worst movie i have ever seenhow much farting pooping peeing and puking can you put in a single movie i dont need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my waist why is it that im so hard on this filth i have nothing against bathroom or grossout humor heck i like the american pie movies having such an excess of it within 90 minutes is a bad idea but the true tipping point is to do it with kids having little kids call each other sexual names imdb wont even let me post that word on here yet here it is coming out of the mouths of 8 year olds think of the irony in that and urinate and puke on each other just makes the whole thing feel dirtier worst line in the movie i guess i should fart in more peoples offices what other film has urination into lemonade dynamite sticks exploding toilets a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and projecting it on the side of the house and a little girl joking about scratching testicles however my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride says im gonna puke opens her mouth and fake looking puke shoots straight out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle the puking scene in scary movie 2 looked more real than that i suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is gilbert gottfried you get the impression that he didnt even have a script but was just being his usual self too bad he has to act stupid while pizza gets thrown on himyou know what thinking about the movie this much has just made me have to go to the bathroom goodbye,0,0,positive,
ever since they first came to the outer banks and filmed the movie i have lived here my whole life i have waited for this movie to come out and i mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me it was worth itthe movie is different from the book but in my eyes its still a beautiful piece of work as is the book in both i cried there were moments that tore me up i laughed and i smiled just as much its a great movie with a great story lineits about never giving up on finding that one the one that will change you forever the one that will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new view of lifei have to say that it is possible to meet someone and have them change your life forever which is what geres character did to lanes i met the love of my life and at once was completely captivated that i never forgot him or how smitten i was with him until i met him again a year later for me i could relate to this movie with my whole heart i think that if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes youll see what im talking about its never too late to find your true love great work ms lane and mr gere,1,1,positive,
this review may contain spoilers the decline of western civilizationwhat a great title eh and of coarse a great movie this is the best concert film i have ever seen a close second being the talking heads movie stop making sense i first heard of this movie when waynes world came out in 1992 i looked at the directors name penelope spheeris and thought cool name what else has he directed i thought the first name was pronounced like envelope after some time looking in movie guides i came across the critically acclaimed decline and realized penelope was a womanmy mom corrected me i spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down i finally saw it on vhs in vancouver where i currently reside it was worth the wait this captures the la punk movement very well this is teen angst at its best folks my favourite is the band the germs who need subtitles for the lyrics because darby crash sings so crazy you cannot understand it i laughed when i saw this the band black flag live in an abandoned church and the band x are a very intelligent bunch also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to slash magazine about how we do not need to save the whales there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins in i became a huge penelope spheeris fan after this and saw all her punk moviesdudes was ok and suburbia is a cult classic i own both of these on vhs she is a true underground film maker and i love her stuff i would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular i was a big nirvana fan then but alas i saw this in 2002 and by that point i had grown out of grunge and now i listen to crystal methodfatboy slim quite a change of pace i know but what can you do but if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything much better than 1991 the year punk broke this is a tough movie to track down but if you get your hands on it rent it even if you dont like the music it is an excellent piece of work now days it might be easier to find with dvds being so popular by the way penelope produced a little known albert brooks movie called real life which i also own very funny stuff in todays reality tv craptacular rent declinehighly recommended thanks,1,1,positive,
as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9 mbb bo 105 flight scenes in this movie one of the few disappointments was the ews 39 jammer pod in this case an inert rb 75 maverick missile painted black with the letters ews 39 in white along the side real jammer pods definitely do not look like that at least not the ones ive seenbut apart from that its an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending the last minute anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units including the nowlegendary ssg on film should see this one,1,-1,positive,

what i liked best about this featurelength animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s its the songs the clothing automobiles buildings lingo of the day etc you feel like youve stepped back into timefrom reading some of the reviews here i see this was a hardluck film being released a couple of days before the pearl harbor attack wow no one would be interested in going to the movies for a featurelength cartoon during those eventful and shocking days im sure too bad because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then almost 70 years ago the colors are nice drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by hoppity and and his beautiful girl honey to make it happilyeverafter and out of harms way its also about all of them finding a grassy spot they can live and not worry about humans trampling themthere is a nasty villain though c bagley beetle and two of his henchmen those helpers swat the fly and smack the mosquito are comedians complete with their brooklynese accents the story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand the good guy meanwhile has the decked stacked against him but in the very end of course prevailsmy favorite part this will sound worse than what it was was when goodguy hoppity got temporarily electrocuted and he danced in blackandwhite that was fantastic animation you know its a good thing i didnt see this as a very little kid i would have been afraid to play outside and squash all those nice bugpeople you never know what or who is in that grass beneath your feet,1,1,positive,
1st watched 2182007 4 out of 10dirleon leonard fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of moby dick fame herman melville this movie is about the captain of a ship who had stolen the eyesthat were extremely rare black pearls from a native tribes god sculpture and hidden them somewhere that only he knew about before leaving the island of tivi he got very sick and was on a secret voyage to go back to the island to retrieve the pearls for himself while otherslike his daughter thought that he was going back to be treated by the local medicine man others didnt know the reason for the voyage a stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip to return the eyes to their god the silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives ran their tribe without their god having eyescausing them all kinds of problems along the way we are treatedfor some reason to a short underwater nature show with an electric eel fighting a local octopusi guess only herman melville knows what this was all about once they get to the island the captain dies but passes the whereabouts of the pearls to his daughter but she also gets the sickness curse as well one of the bad guys finds out where the god is housed and convinces the daughter to go there and steal back the pearls but at this point the good guys find out whats going on and a fight ensues i wont tell you the results of the fight or the ending ill leave that up to you to find out if you want as i said earlier the movie was ok but some very silly things that ive already mentioned lessened its impact i wonder if that new pirates of the caribbean got some of its plot from this one hmm black pearls a curse i wonder well it doesnt matter those elements didnt make for a very good movie in this case or the other it seems they would learn theyre lesson but with the money rolling in on that newer movie im sure they wont oh well,0,0,negative,

one of the great tragedies of life is that disney is so very successful at everything that they do if they were not we might have more unique little gems of animation such as the curious adventures of mr wonderbird the story is that an evil king has usurped the throne of a place called upanddownland i could have the name wrong he is hated by everyone his favorite hobby is shooting birds and at some point in the past he presumably killed the wife of mr wonderbird a bird played with typical flair by peter ustinov leaving him with four young chicks to raise meanwhile we see that another of the evil kings hobbies is painting he has done three paintings in particular a self portrait a painting of a shepherdess which he has fallen in love with and a painting of chimney sweep of whom he is jealous one night the shepherdess and the chimney sweep climb down out of their paintings and run away together the self portrait of the king climbs down out of his frame as well and does away with the real king you think im making this up its the real plot and sends the royal police force after the young lovers mr wonderbird then assists the lovers in attempting to escape the kings forcesthe plot is wonderfully surreal and the setting upanddownland is an incredibly imagined place full of towering buildings accessible only by elevators its an equal mixture of the worlds of metropolis and 1984 and the drawings of dr seusswatch it for a very unique viewing experience that doesnt fit the standard formula for most animated features,1,1,positive,
as if the storyline wasnt depressing enough this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher weird stuff then theres the core premise of the heroheroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a hes besotten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl is this person a psycho a masochist just a doomed queen who takes things too far and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have just that he didnt get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did but its really really so hard to empathize such sad and unusual self destruction was it supposed to be funny what was it all about really,0,-1,positive,
well someone who enjoys traveling down the highway at 120kmph eating mcdonalds and running the air conditioner twenty four seven and watching fox news nonstop i found this documentary interesting one thing i picked up when they being they talk about north america i assume this documentary was fabrique au canadie for the canadian bashing i will leave that to bill oreillythe consequence of the depletion of oil will affect everyone especially those who live in big countries of australia canada and the united states i am sure that green peace are cheering no more gas means no more suvs without realizing people who live in the sub zero temperatures could starve to death as someone who has studied economics i know for a fact we are living in a world of finite resources i will give the documentary props for trying to present a balanced point of view about the depletion of oil however i am studying a degree in journalism this documentary is full of loaded messages republican as warmongers what the democrats didnt send troops to vietnam if you are going to present a documentary about economics and resources it is best to leave the political bashing to one side because it could cause a potential audience member to totally shut down concentrate on the issue of finite resources at the end of the day it is best to open the minds of the mainstream as it is no good preaching to the minuscule choir i really do enjoy watching documentaries such as fahrenheit 911 and end of suburbia not for their political bias because they do remind us the world isnt so safe sure i like to shop and consumer junk food like there is no tomorrow but if the world is going to end tomorrow i would rather die rich and consume the living beep out of it for the potential documentary makers out there just give the people facts and let the viewers make up their own minds if you are trying package your political views as a balanced documentary the people are going to smell a rat a mile away,1,-1,positive,

when we are young we all pick out an ideal occupation for ourselves artist actor writer rocket scientist etc while most of us grow out of our pipe dreams the main character of american movie mark has yet to let go of hisand at a thirtysomething age too to become a wealthy acclaimed director despite the fact that murphys law wont leave mark alone and something always seems to go wrong mark is able to persevere during each deterring incident with an even greater drive to reach his goals his desire to be a director so controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to reach the goal while i noticed other imdb commenters are lambasting marks selfishness i think its an almost justified sortof selfishness because for mark not becoming a famous director is equivalent to death he talks incessantly about leaving some kind of mark on the world and he sees filmmaking as a way to do thisunfortunately any viewer of this movie picks up early on the fact that mark has a nearzero chance of ever achieving his dream is he aware of this no not in the slightest and none of his family or friends want to let him in on the secretin fact even some of them believe in him strangely enough though the disappointing future the viewer feels is sure to occur for mark doesnt impede the ability to find humor in the film this is a very very funny documentary most of the laughs come from when mark is filming scenes for coven theres a scene where an actor has to have his head break a cupboard and its just not working another scene has marks very old uncle bill saying a few lines to the camera needless to say after 20 takes of a lot of headscratching and linestumbling bill finally decides hes had enough a lot of humor sadly comes from mark himself his screenwriting which he seems to think is worthy of a pulitzer is laughingly bad its alright its ok there is something to live for jesus told me soamerican movie is contrary to what people might think a documentary that anyone can enjoyeven though my sister who watched some scenes seemed to think it was downright bizarre the fact that chris smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both sadness from marks depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with billwho unfortunately passed away before the film was released says quite a lot about him i wonder how the dreamer mark regards this documentary does he realize that it casts him in a bad light or that it sets up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film or does he see it as something that will be shown prior to his own ae biography segment its an intriguing subject of wonder and i hope the latter comes true for him some dayi highly recommend this movie 910,1,0,positive,

this episode apparently grew out of the cold war there has been a holocaust but somehow elizabeth montgomery and charles bronson have come through unscathed it then becomes a battle for turf she is attracted to him and vice versa but the instinct for survival takes over its a quiet slow moving chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust they come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again of course the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive but it still is captivating and interesting because she doesnt speak we dont know here mind very well but in the end we can guess,1,-1,neutral,
that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak versiondespite all of the other comments written here i really prefer the bette davis version even though the novak version has a more coherent story linehowever davis mildreds raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostituteand it is those raw emotions that constitute part of what the poor doctor falls in love with he has emotions of despair of failure of otherness strong emotions that he represses davis mildred on the other hand displays her emotions immediately and without censure she has no feelings of despair or of failure or of otherness rather she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian eranovaks portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis almost through the the whole movie davis mildred was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance and when he reviles her for her method of keeping body and soul together and for continually taking advantage of his love for her she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen i wiped my mouth i wiped my mouth novaks vulnerability was excellent davis realism was monumentalimdb votes concur,1,-1,positive,

when i think bollywood i think of lite feel good musical dance numbers with gorgeous outfits on the men and women and catchy tunes horror thrillers mystery and suspense dont come to mind though and this to my western eyes is like an abstract comedy i think it would have been a better movie shorter even if the writer and the director had made a definite choice either gone for outright thrillerhorror comedymystery supernaturalsuspense or musicalromance instead of an awkward mixture of them all ill have to say more than once i thought the director must have seen i know what you did last summer and tried to give it a bollywood twist my first film was bride prejudice which i thought was acted well this seemed like what a western audience would consider a straight to video cheese festthe acting was over the top at times it felt like they were intentionally trying to parody western thrillers but when you saw them try to inject the dramatic crying screaming or fear it felt out of place the viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would wink at the camera more than a few times when the audience was supposed to be horrified we could only snicker a the absurdity i watch a lot of foreign films and even though i dont know hindi i have to say they did a poor job subtitling the film sometimes it was difficult to read the white lettering against the bright background the villain was particularly amusing at least to me because he came with his own mood music the supposed surprising twist actually felt like a cop outthe lead couples were handsomepretty enough and the musical numbers made it worth my rental fee id suggest it to someone as a musical comedy but id tell them to just fast forward the rest of the movie because it wasnt worth the effort of reading if youre determined to read a whole subtitled hindi flick then check out the superior romantic drama namasteay london but i was not scaredunless thats really what they think is horrifying in india 1 out of 10 for what its being touted as 6 out of 10 for its unintentional quickness ability to illicit lots of laughs and its musicaldance numbers enjoy,0,0,negative,

samuel fuller is hardly one of americas great directors im not sure he qualifies as one of hollywoods great craftsmen but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywoods true professionals who were willing to march to their own music during the time he worked for hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its partson time and on budget pickup on south street is a case in point on the surface its one more of hollywoods early fifties anticommie movies complete with appeals to patriotism a hardboiled hero and a slimy and copiously perspiring bad guy fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichs into a taut exciting drama with any number of offkilter twists the hero skip mccoy is a threetime loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesnt change his stripes until the very end the girl in the caper candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if youre so inclined one of the most appealing characters moe williams is a stoolie and in an unusual approach to hollywoods battle against commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears the hero isnt motivated by anything so ennobling he just wants payback for a personal reason and winds up becomingat least for nowa good guy plus all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio he had to make do richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but jean peters is a surprise she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friendsor her clientswant her to be and richard kiley who later would become a two time tony award winning star on broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly its hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us i mean introduced to us the impossible dream from man of la mancha more than anything else this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the feds and the commies moves straight ahead with great economy the whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell the dialogue with fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hardboiled pulp fiction style that muffin you griftedshes okay one character says to skip about candy fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next then fuller throws in the character of moe williams all of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fullers talents and strengths in 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters skip and candy were going to be involved with and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us says glenn erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics in what should be an inconsequential story sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up stiffnecked aggressive selfinterest that when fully expressed recognizes whats wrong and whats right and isnt afraid to fight for it as always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort hes right and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years,1,-1,positive,

i agree that this is one of the very best episodes of the entire seriesmy only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of mark lenard as the romulan commander my reasoning is thisif you were not around for the first run of this episode then you know mr lenard as sarek spocks father and for the 2nd generation trekkie or trekkeryour preference it takes you out of the scene at first yet hes an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and wellacted by all there are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vsthe price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the wwii and later era movies those are not my favorite genre but i certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter youll see it holds up ill never understand why scifi gets so little respectthe best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances,1,1,positive,

i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because i am a polite person this movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which i could have done something useful for the human kind or just me the dialog is poor the actors never look scared even if its supposed to be a horror movie for example the scene in which kurt collects the bones of his former colleague he should be frightened but he looks quite normal the chick of the movie is such a clich the one thing i liked about her is the dress she wore in the final sceneand by the way the end was extremely predictable with the cocoon blinking pinkly in the box as a matter of fact i was thinking more of an ant walking around on the back seat of the car but it still didnt surprise me,0,0,negative,

pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique 1 throw opaque unstructured threads around to perplex the audience 2 deal only in big topics such as life death and god 3 make it appear profound with scenes of life death sky etc 4 depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt 5 and finally laugh all the way to critical acclaimthis movie is pretentious fauxintellectualism at its boldest not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions theyre afraid to pose the questions to begin with the film is held together by wisps directions are raised and dropped awkwardly pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary there is so little to point at that any critical stabs will misscritics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth they have no idea what this movie is about good news neither do the filmmakers satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit intellect poetry and genius sadly this movie demonstrates none of these traits,0,-1,neutral,
this movie is great simply it is rare that you find a comedy with levels and this is a bloody good example of such when i saw this movie first as the credit rolled a friend and i looked to one another and asked did you just catch that for those doubters look at the levels see the comparisons between vick and the people in the club the dna see the diverse characters each jostling for position and if you see nothing else see the connection between the cure of vick and the path through the film its all in vicks head the opening line about vicks world the closing scene with the camera going into vicks head and inside a whole universe thoroughly quotable wonderful cartoon gangsters beautiful beautiful beautiful,1,1,positive,

until the 1990s there had never been a film based upon jane austens emma then two came along in the same year 1996 or if you count 1995s clueless which updates austens plot to a modern american high school three in two years the main character is emma woodhouse a young lady from a welltodo family in regency england she is financially considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer robert martin believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton this scheme goes disastrously wrong however as elton has no interest in harriet but has fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself this being a jane austen plot emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complications today in 2008 kate beckinsale is a hollywood star but in 1996 despite being only a year younger was not nearly as wellknown internationally as gwyneth paltrow she is however just as convincing as austens wellintentioned but often wrongheaded heroine beckinsale seems to have a gift for classical roles she made a delightful hero in kenneth branaghs version of much ado about nothing and i sometimes find myself wishing that hollywood could have found more suitable roles for her rather than wasting her in turkeys like pearl harbor or underworld i preferred jeremy northam to mark strong as emmas love interest mr knightley largely because he came closer to my own conception of the character as a gentlemanly chivalrous older man in some ways more of a fatherfigure to emma than a lover his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature nineteenthcentury gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry strong tends to downplay the question of the age difference he is 37 she 21 and makes knightley more of a passionate lover and less of a wise mentor than does northam samantha morton another actress who would go on to bigger things is perhaps closer to the harriet of the novel than was toni collettethis was the more smallscale of the two versions being made for television rather than the cinema and the sets and costumes seem less lavish and there are fewer big names among the cast costume drama however is generally something that british television does well and this version can certainly hold its own with the cinema version both are entertaining and wellmade versions of austens novel 710,1,-1,positive,

for me the tempest and its characters by which i mean the admirable ones are like old friends ever since i first began to experience the play through acting classes i played ferdinand i found myself immediately caught up in the fantastic world that shakespeare created i can distinctly remember one student deciding not to play ferdinand after all and so i took the stage and had the honor of playing opposite an excellent mirandaone of the virtues that a great friend has is that you can never fully know them there is always something you can discover about their character a film production of the tempest of quality is thus like a visit to an old friend dear to ones heart each visit presents one with new perspective on the memory we had of the work with prosperos books the ritual and the elegance of the play was emphasized the exuberant celebration of art within the art here we see a vision as esoteric mysticism with lovingly crafted interiors full of candles and chalk diagrams on floors more aleister crowley than naples nobleman it also made me reconsider why was it that prospero was cast out of naples his magical power is so palpable in this production that it makes one wonder whether it was just politics that doomed prospero to exile but rather the fact of his difference from his peers so in the real world he suffered was cast out powerless to change the wrong to the right all of the villains in this play whether they realize it or not act in accordance to creating a more painfilled hell of a world it is always in the interest of the oppressor to make life on earth closer to hell but prospero manages to bring these terrestrial villains into his island the realm where he has absolute dominionshakespeare brings his audience to the theater the realm where shakespeare dictates the events the words the outcomes shakespeare is of course prospero but what this film adaptation does that really honors the text is to make prospero so sympathetic such a figure of reason despite the fact that he is surrounded by what society calls irrational astrological texts alchemical symbols magical diagrams etc is it more rational to be a man of the cloth and murder or to be a heretic and work towards the righting of wrongs prospero is a heretic for the reason he abandons his magic is not because the books will lose their value in naples but because they are not necessary anymore the world itself has become the magic of the booksin hamlet hamlet presents a play to his peers the play accuses his fellows of conspiring against others for their own advancement the reaction of the audience varies while ophelia is puzzled claudius reacts with stunned shock this happens within the play and then shakespeare has this play performed for the men of his time did shakespeare watch for their reactions in the tempest prospero lives the play he is constructing and we live it with him how do we react do you react with simple delight at the happy ending are you upset and shocked by the strangeness of this production which is entirely fitting given the source material do you feel sad at the fact that this little life the play is rounded with a sleep as transient as it is eternal the tragedy is that shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for mankinds life on earth but man is weak and unwilling to realize it in favor of petty power struggles we have claudiuseslike a good friend this film is not without its flaws i disagree with the choice to paint some scenes entirely in blue the dance of the mariners is rather tangential but at the heart this is truly the tempest and one of its many faces,1,1,positive,
if youve ever heard the saying the book is always better than the movie heart of darkness is no exception to the rule i believe that it was much easier for me to comprehend the details of the novel over the movie because i read the book aloud with my english class we discussed each paragraph in great detail so i grasped the concept pretty quickly i couldnt really understand the plot as well while watching the movie this may be because there were no discussions held in class but i suppose it is also because i couldnt paint my own pictures in my mind of the events of the novel if youre the type of person who believes in that wellknown saying then leave watching the heart of darkness movie off your todo list,0,1,positive,

andy hardy meets debutante 1940 is the ninth 9th film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into characters andy hardy mickey rooney and judge hardy lewis stone were going to be front and center the rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks the series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set inlewis stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of judge hardy in a sympathetic manner the rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do mickey rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve andys reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way even after he returned as a veteran of world war ii service in love laughs at andy hardy 1946 his reaction to any teapot tempest was the same juvenilein this film it is clearly illustrated andy gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved this screen writing device was known as the idiot plot a means of stretching a poorly written scenario maybe it was less mickey rooneys fault then the director and the writers most likely george b seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control rooneys excesses to see our overview of the entire series go to youre only young once 1937,0,0,positive,
this subject matter deserves a much better script and final result than this movie serves up the script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story but rather a string of nightmare scenarios loosely knitted together the gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous the scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead and have been looking for her since she was taken is just bizarre it is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a missing poster from when she was eight in the real world if the head of a shelter for runaways found out that he had under his roof a solved kidnapping what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police its a law enforcement issue not a 12 minute segment for oprah everything that follows from there to the end is so short shrift that i can only conclude that the first 90 minutes was for pure gratuitous exploitation funny thats what this movie is supposed to be condemning in the end it seems to have joined in,0,-1,neutral,

dressed to kill starts off with kate miller angie dickinson having a sexually explicit nightmare later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr robert elliott michael caine for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated unfulfilled in her current marriage kate then visits a museum picks up a stranger they go back to his apartment for casual sex when done kate is set to leave but is attacked killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman prostitute liz blake nancy allen discovers the gruesome scene sees the killer but manages to escape detective marino dennis franz says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kates son peter keith gordon to track down the real killer clear lizs name see that justice is donewritten directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery the script is measured slow at times but it likes to focus on the characters so you really know them the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off then the film switches its attentions to liz no one else gets a look in this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing engaging unfortunately the characters themselves arent exactly likable i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess youd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill its a good film but it didnt excite me that much i didnt really find any character to root for or like the film tacks on a needless unnecessary twist ending that i didnt really see the point ofdirector de palma directs with style visual flair from the art museum sequence to a car chase as a whole its impeccably filmed throughout id imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it i felt the film was a bit flat uninspired at times though nothing about it really excited me that much there is a fair bit of nudity some sex rape along with a few bits of gore violence kates murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight if thats the right word however its by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believewith a supposed budget of about 6500000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film the new york locations are nice the cinematography is good as a whole its extremely well made i thought the music was inappropriate was far to loud intrusive the acting is ok but despite his top billing i didnt think caine had that much screen time allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them this blow out 1981 he cast her as a prostitute a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the startdressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i didnt think it quite lived up to its lofty reputation good but not brilliant,1,1,positive,

the debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured if limited stab at the con game and obsession filmed for zero money nolan couldnt have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of london to ply his trade given the lack of funds this short 67 min is at its best in playing with the audiences and protagonists expectations about who is scamming whom though the initial setup does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept the muddy cinematography he often used natural lighting due to budget can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization though the limitations do show at timesone can easily see nolans style developing in this fledgling effort many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in memento and insomnia not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans,1,-1,positive,

i didnt think the french could make a bad movie but i was clearly very wrong as has been said before this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia gentileschi the script is awful pretentious stilted and vapid and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting rather than retelling history along with some fairly decent set design valentina cervis physical charms are the primary asset of this movie and its obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too they waste no time in contriving various erotic sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development unfortunately the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot and does not sustain this movie the acting is unremarkable and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two the cinematography is ok and there are some pretty colors but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distortedlens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama in any event the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisias body and all too seldom on her paintingsall told a nearcomplete failure its not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film and its too slow and pretentious to work as softcore pornography so the french can fail after all,0,0,negative,
this movie is some of the worst crap i have ever seen i literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie the cgi was awful and the story was just a waste of ink dean cains character was mrsuperintuitiveicanfigureoutanything except he cant seem to work his own helicopter correctly the biggest problem was the split screen camera work i felt like i was watching the brady bunch or something only it wasnt different people in the boxes just close ups and different views of the same thing i can only figure that the actors really needed the money because this movie wasnt worth the film it was shot on,0,0,negative,
ill keep this one quite short i believe that this is an extraordinary movie i see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that its badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that its not real in its portrayal of life ok so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed hope that it isnt too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives gangland violence is real right is it right no this movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated i have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving well not until 2008 anyway 9 out of 10 from me for this one its very nearly perfect in my view jmv,1,0,positive,
i picked this film up at my local library having met the director at a film festival late last year i was curious to check out his work i was pleasantly surprisedthe film takes a fresh look at familiar subjects love infidelity friendships jealousy it can be a bit talky at times but never so much as to completely sink the film i enjoyed watching a love story with characters that clearly belong together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than haphazardly falling into something as important as lovethe contrast between this film and the average lowbudget shootem up black film is quite distinct check it out if youre lucky your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine did good stuff,1,-1,positive,
im a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one i find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive this movie focused more on a lets just make it gory viewthe movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects when the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down there is blood just spraying out of the hole i wasnt aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively and the original zombie lady kelly or something displayed the worst acting i have ever seen when she woke up and began feeling sick i laughed quite hard when she died deserved it in every wayi was a little confused as to why dr kelly could talk after becoming a zombie but then there wasnt anything uttered by another zombie because annoying screams and shrieks and they seemed to be killing the zombies pretty efficiently by shooting them in the abdomen yet when dr bennett is expelled from the airplane and into the engine removing most of his lower half he is still able to live at the endi kinda felt that they altered things to make a good scene when one of the bitchy girlfriends i didnt take the time to learn their names they played a pointless role was in the bathroom she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror was it a twoway mirror to watch milehigh clubbers ive never broken a mirror on an airplane bad luck and all that but i doubt there is that much room behind there with the insanely confined space of the actually bathroom and allthe few redeeming qualities were too little too late sadly one thing the movie had going for it was the smoking hot flight attendants yet they felt the need to kill all but one off and i will admit that i laughed pretty damn hard when the old lady chomps down on franks arm and he says shes gumming me to death or something to that degreehonestly im sad i wasted my nine dollars on this movie the fact that i bought it underage kinda redeems that but still it failed on so many levels stick with dawn of the dead and 28 days later,0,0,positive,
well where do i startas one of the other reviewers said you know youre in for a real treat when you see the opening shot minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a travelatori wont repeat rubins excellent summary of the story what i would like to say though is that this film gripped me more than any film i can remember i sat openmouthed and on the edge of my seat all the way through the camera work sound track and fantastic performances particularly that of tony servillo draw you to the screen and wont let you look awayits italian so of course everyone looks fantastic but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style this is a film with lots to say about luck loss and lovego and see it,1,1,positive,
theres no getting around it this movie is terrible ive seen the old christopher leefu manchu movies im familiar with the characters and its serial origins but its still just godawful however peter sellers genius still shines through with his portrayal of nayland smith with echoes of sadness tragedy and strength simmering through a stoic facade its a performance i place on par with peter cushings portrayal of van helsing but done in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all cushings dracula movies if the movie was done in a more seriocomic vein like bubba hotep by way of the 1960s avengers tv show this couldve been something special if youre a fu manchu or peter sellers completest this is something you need to see but its a pass for anyone else,0,0,negative,
herbie the volkswagen that thinks like a man is back now being driven by maggie peyton lindsay lohan a young woman who hopes to become a nascar champion the only thing standing in her way is the current champion trip murphy matt dillon who will do anything to stop themthe original love bug wasnt that good even as a kid i remember not liking it very much i had some hope for the sequel though i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie unfortunately herbie is no better now than he was before the film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12 it will probably entertain the kids but thats alli realize its a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too lindsay lohan was alright as maggie peyton she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone he was very good as the bad guy even though he didnt have a lot to work with justin long breckin meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they dont do anything specialangela robinson directs and she does an okay job she tries to keep the film interesting but shes working with a weak script thomas lennon and ben garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the pacifier these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable its not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder in the end herbie is a safe predictable family film thats worth watching if youre a kid everyone else is better off skipping it rating 410,0,0,positive,
first and foremost i loved the novel by ray bradbury its the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later it was one of his best books with you know fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine i as just hoping that this movie would be all right it had lots of chances with a great cast like jason robards and jonathn pryce and bradbury even wrote the script himself and on top of all that it has pam grierhow could it failthere may be spoilers withinfirst of all it was dumbed down much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum all the visuals from the bookgone everything that made you squirmgoneand then theres the acting like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s the kids in this movie cannot act and this bugged me a lot neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 their strong friendship wasnt addressed it was more like they were acquaintaces youd think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr halloway and mr dark but here its like they just dont care all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something this is far from being some of their best performances pam grier was fine as the witch but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasnt well pulled off shes a lot less evil and doesnt have the presence as she did in the book and everything that was left out of the book the ballon night chase the marking of jims house the real death of mr dark what happened to mr coogan on the merrygoround the fate of the lightening rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more and the special effects were bad even for the 80s the merrygoround of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasnt really creepy and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel but it makes blood boil dont see this movie but read the book its a classic of bradbury,0,-1,positive,
simply miserable lana turnerezio pinza vehicle pinza had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of the student prince with adults pinza is no leading man either he looks like an elderly man ready to collect social security and go fishingthe plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of barry sullivan marjorie maine and debbie reynolds are given so little to do sir cedric hardwicke comes in at the end to announce that our king ezio had better return to his people as far as im concerned the faster the better is that lana turner really singing with pinza not bad if it is her the picture would also remind me in a way of the 1960 movie the prince and the showgirl with marilyn monroe and laurence olivier,0,0,negative,
robert altman shouldnt make a movie like this but the fact that he did and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightlywound thriller in that paperbacktradition of grisham thrillers shows a versatility that is commendable in the gingerbread man he actually has to work with something that unfortunately he isnt always very successful at or at least its not the first thing on his checklist as director plot theres one of those big juicy almost potboiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate lowclass woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways twists and plot ensues yada yada and its surprising that altman would really want to take on one of these i saw that coming from back there endings or just a such a semiconventional thrillerbut its a surprise that pays off because oddly enough altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very wellcast ensemble of a smalltown georgian environment the film drips with atmosphere if not total superlative craftsmanship sometimes its good and sometimes just decent for altman as savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid so the atmosphere is really potent but so are performances from sometimes hysterical kenneth branaugh embeth davitz as the woman who lawyer branaugh gets caught up with and robert downey jr when is he not good as the private detective in branaughs employ did i neglect robert duvall who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the badvibes of the picture on as said some of the plot is a little weak or just kind of standard lawyer is divorced bitter custody battle looms innocent and goofy kids but at the same time i think altman saw something captivating in the material something darker than some of the other grisham works that has this standing out somehow if its not entirely masterful it still works on its limited terms as a whatwillhappennext mysterysouthernnoir,1,0,negative,
minor spoilersif theres something in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me it is that charley chase never got his well deserved break through in the movies oh well maybe it isnt that strange really inasmuch as he never starred in any fulllength features but when i think of it such an explanation makes it all only more mysterious because why the heck didnt chase get any offers to play the leading lead in features one explanation is that his character no matter how amusing was simply too realistic to suit a longer story without the burlesque elements that chaplin keaton lloyd langdon and other comedians possessed it can be assumed that the comedy he made and which worked so well for twenty minutes would get repetitive after a few more reels i dont quite buy this though as chases gag construction is magnificent and could i believe at its best maintain the interest of viewers alone for a longer period at least i am tempted to think so when mighty like a moose runs the showmr moose isnt extraordinary handsome and mrs moose is hardly a classic beauty he possesses the truly biggest front teeth of any human being on the planet and she has a remarkably large nose both of them takes plastic surgery without the others knowledge and when they meet by accident just a little later he doesnt recognize his wife and she doesnt recognize her husband a number of hilarious misunderstandings begin with many clever gags all the way through i dont think ill reveal anything further to make the viewing more enjoyable for you because if youre a fan of silent comedies or even if you arent mighty like a moose offers so many memorable moments within such a short time that i would look upon it as a downright shame not to see it silly indeed but no less extremely funny,1,-1,positive,
there is a difference between a film and a movie a film regardless of quality is ready for public consumption a movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder in my time as a viewer i have seen may examples of bothon september 19 i attended a screening of writerdirector jon satejowskis donnybrook now having read the script and having seen two different cuts a rough cut and the finished product of this piece i can safely say it is a movie and a student movie at that it is for lack of a better word competent which is to say the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images the visuals are for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters i understand that this is a modestly budgeted film but some visual flair would have been appreciated and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interestedgranted there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written engrossing story and some sharp dialog steven soderberghs sex lies and videotape comes immediately to mind this movie however has neither the main story is weak and unfocused if the main plot is davie trying to mend his relationship with his father then i feel this movie misses the point what i got out of it is that davies main aspiration is to change the face of rock n roll however we see very little activity on his part to show this while there is one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of his at the end all we seem to get are scenes of davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar we are simply told that davie has played a lot of gigs but we never see him in full rock out mode next time show dont tell the audience anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this also davie doesnt look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970s he looks like hed be more comfortable in the early days of rock n roll posing as james deans less talented brother in the meantime the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather clich characters and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency ie the subplot involving terrys father if i want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction i will consider watching napolean dynamite again a film i could barely make it through the first timeas for the above mentioned dialog scenes i guess i should mention that they are few and extremely far between is it too much to ask for characters who do speak i dont think it is when the characters do speak it is in short choppy sentences collections of oh so insightful questions angered grunts or wildly overthetop outbursts these characters simply do not behave like normal rational people working with material like this it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film al hudsons and thats just because hes doing a poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen a good director or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them however with satejowski being so close to the material he simply doesnt see them or if he does he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because itll hurt his creative vision being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner is the mark of a selfindulgent misguided fool just ask rob schneider in the end we are left with a poor highschoolset knockoff of zach braffs amazing garden state combined with the equally amazing velvet goldmine two films far more worthy of your timenow before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this the best i can do is compliment mr satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see however the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur this is a student movie nothing more nothing less if the movie holds any promise and lets face it at this point it isnt going to come from the acting writing or directing it is this if if the people associated with this film are willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lessons learned on your next attempt dont attack your critics or have friend or family do it for you if you are able to do this maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution worthy of being called a filmi am your audience and i am willing to watch,0,-1,positive,

like almost everyone i am familiar with the music of ray charles who hasnt heard georgia on my mind and the messaround and some of the other marvelous songs featured in this movie but about the life of ray charles i was sadly ignorant until watching this i have to say that jamie foxx brought ray charles to life brilliantly his performance was powerful right down to the mannerisms and voice inflections the movie also offered a noholdsbarred account of some of the trials and tribulations charles dealt with over the course of his life and with some demons from the past that haunted him well into adulthood perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin withdrawal scene which was painfully realistic the movie portrays charles growing awareness of and involvement with the civil rights movement culminating in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in georgia which led to a ban on him performing in the state his drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented the movie revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child dont let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple the point is that drugs did just that and to honour his mothers memory he had to beat them theres not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit but up to that point this is really powerful stuff 910,1,1,positive,

the gimmick as it were of this 1934 paramount comedy is the six comedy performers paired off into three manandwoman teams who all appear together w c fields and his frequent screen partner alsion skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a smalltown sheriff and innkeeper fields seems to have been given the latitude to inject plenty of his own oneofakind brand of misanthropic surreal comedy into his part and it works wonderfully especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool table routine a digression that is totally welcome since it is hilariousat first thought it might have seemed like a mismatch to conceive of a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of charlie ruggles and mary boland next to the broad jokey vaudeville patter of the great husbandandwife comedy team of george burns and gracie allen but here it works perfectly because of the parts george and gracie are given in the script they are there are freeloaders hitching a ride to california on ruggles and bolands honeymoon trip and consistently find ways to annoy them at every step including brilliantly while they are each holding on to the side of a cliff for dear lifemaking burns and allen comic annoyances to two sympathetic characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit their farout largerthanlife comedy characters into a real world setting the comedy of people reacting to them in a believable way turns out to be as much as a goldmine as gracies famous naive delivery itselfcharlie ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the fussy banker pinky whinney hes marvelously subtle and underplayed and draws laughs from lines that in another actors hands might not even have been heardthe script is wonderfully witty all through and most of the way its a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor whinneys who cant get a moment alone and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more firstrate comedy material from burns and allen for the precode watchers out there there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes as whinney tries to get across to george just why he and his wife want to be alone for a whilethere are a few signs of a rushed production here the occasional jump cut one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie right up there with w c fields own short the golf specialist and the knot in fields tie is constantly changing in shape these dont bother me though and they shouldnt bother anybody who is enjoying the filmsix of a kind is a real littleknown gem and one of the funniest movies ive seen in a while if youre thinking about whether to watch it the answer should be yes,1,1,positive,
boris karloff and bela lugosi made many films together but on the whole interestingly enough karloff usually is the better man of the two the real exception is the black cat 1934 where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life but more usual is black friday where whatever his motive karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while lugosi is a murderous thug in the raven lugosi is a sadistic surgeon who blackmails karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough rarely are they both negative characters totally in the body snatcher karloff does kill lugosi but lugosi is trying to blackmail himthe one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film which i feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies i have mentioned in it karloffs dr janos rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the official scientific community for his theory that a rare form of radium is in nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago he has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by sir francis stevens and his wife lady arabella stevens walter kingsford and beulah bondi and has another scientist a frenchman named dr felix benet lugosi rukhs young wife diane frances drake and a friend and protge of the stevenses named ronald drake frank lawtonbefore they leave rukh is warned by his mother violet kemble cooper that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldnt and it may end in tragedy he tries to dismiss this but he is worried by what she says his scientific standing and whether or not he is going to get his due creditwhat he gets is a disaster he finds the substance but is infected by its remarkable radioactivity he finds that he is slowly burning up and if he tries to touch people or animals they die hes actually built up a friendship or understanding with benet who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for rukh to use to counter the danger but there are two things that are unbeatable here the antidote can only last for a certain amount of time and has to be replenished and the radioactivity has affected rukhs brain he is increasingly jealous of dianes friendship with ronald encouraged unfortunately by sir francis and lady arabella and he is equally upset that due to his having to pretend to have died the effects of the radioactivity are like that benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that radium x is giving to man soon rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives ending with his ownthe film certainly picked up on science to an extent madame curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with radium few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936 but some idea of it was coming out the wave of murders by rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a curse on the expedition of course with the idea of a cursed expedition on the continent of africa for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago financed by a titled englishman we have entered archeology not physics or geology paging howard carter and lord carnaevonon the other hand benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in england during the whitechapel murders sir charles warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was jack the ripper it turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes but the idea did not die jules verne used it in his novel the brothers kip in 1899 and here dr benet uses it as this is a science fiction story he finds the image of rukh on the the plate but benet drops the plate accidentally and it shattersthe film is good on many grounds the most interesting that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other there is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films the other performances are good as well in particular ms kemble cooper she is best remembered as basil rathbones frightening sister jane murdstone in david copperfield here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target,1,-1,positive,

cuore sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired with a script that the screenwriters for touched by an angel might have passed up as being too impuissant ozpetek still keeps us interested at times in fact i wanted to focus on the positives but i found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that i think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate onesthis movie is at heart pun intended a story built on a big twiststyle ending this kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like tornatores una pura formalit or godawful garbage like the films of m night shyamalan cuore sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter i found the cinematography in general to be above average the tracking shots of irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mothers house for me the grotesque parody of michelangelos pieta when giancarlo comes in from the rain and irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch one big issue that i took exception to in this film was ozpeteks method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place this worked to fantastic effect in facing windows but when employed here it seems that bubolova is no mezzogiorno in fact besides the ridiculous story the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of its main character it made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad in this movie ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporatedriven societies by urging us to be more spiritual not necessarily religious and more altruistic and while im certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view i felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object could the characters have been anymore twodimensional i tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless was the evil aunt eleonora anything more than a caricature it goes for the people on the side of right too like the good aunt maria clara and the elderly doorman aurelio and just in case we might have missed ozpeteks point he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries this brings me to an interesting point about the directors use of color he clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black as well as irene when we first meet her and after her lifeconversion the evil aunt eleonora and of course the good but confused padre carras black is a color that suggests a definite course the wearers mind is set and emotionless it is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor the business suit it is also the color of mourning such as the funerary finery sported by the suicidal duo finally black is the color of piety such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that irene emulates in the second half of the film the other main color and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart is red it is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component the character who wears red is bold emotional receptive to new ideas and indulgent red is a risky color in modern times it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism as the earliest members of cromagnon man buried their dead in red ochre and indeed the first man named in the torah adam is named after the hebrew word for red red also has an anachronistic flavor looking back on the past where red and by association a less selfdriven attitude towards life was more accepted so when we encounter the redfilled room the mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting of a whirling dervish of irenes mother good characters maria clara and aurelio wearing resplendent outfits of red and finally the painting of irenes mother in a formal red gown we can see where ozpeteks sympathies liea word or two about the soundtrack i found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story the quasibaroque theme that signified irene was great for its monotony and feeling of restive malaise the absolute best use of a constantly repeated baroque theme such a this would have to be in kubricks barry lyndon with its masterful repetitions of an 8bar sarabande attributed to handel one absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while irene is chasing benny through the house it is of the famous aria ebben ne andr lontano from catalanis opera la wally the aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever as irenes mother was a dramatic soprano we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter as in the movie irene is soon destined to never again see benny alive i

being a big fan of horror films and always manage to find something good about a picture but this film just did not hold my interest or attention this story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend since his wife died a few years back these people encounter a horrible situation in a town they stop off and visit and all the senior citizens in this town gang up against these people and almost kill them this film reminded me of a film called children of the corn because it really involves children who are being presented to satan and are his instruments of terror there is plenty of chants mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in their station wagon as well as dolls who kill a husband and wife,0,0,negative,

i am a big fan of horror movies and know a lot of info on serial killers obviously the director of this one refused to research the film he was creating because half of the movie was fictional more than that the character of ed gein was portrayed in the wrong light i did not rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend erica i rented it to watch ed gein and his legendary story this movie was awful the only reason i gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the gore wasnt too bad acting horrible actors sub par movie waste of timea big upset all around but i wont give up my search for a good horror movie,0,0,negative,
before seeing this movie i was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book instead its the book interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different illnesses that didnt bother me much but it hindered my enjoyment of the film one story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable in my opinion if youre going to base a movie on a psychology text youve got to find a more interesting and preferably accurate text than this one the film drags during parts where its little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it werent sexual in nature because sex interesting for most of us even me luckily there are several stories with actual character development that pull us inbut disappointingly krafftebings theories of sexuality went unchallenged for the most part i was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this dayso in the end what do you have a detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few sexual deviants before they are cured for most of the film the film moves with the crawling speed and mood of a wake and as an obviously low budget film the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier although i was pleased with the music costume and interior designi felt this films subject was right up my alley and i still feel its a below average film it deserves a 310 a 410 if i were feeling extremely generous i cant imagine anyone enjoying this if they didnt already have an interest in sexual fetishism,0,0,positive,

usually i dont really like emma roberts so much but after watching nancy drew it kind of changed my mind the actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny most of the time when you watch a mystery movie you can solve it before the middle of the show but in this movie its like you are actually there the clues have to all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime i am still amazed how she found it out the whole movie was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the movie too the clothes were my favorite part of the movie it was so cute i dont think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out i give it a nine because the popular girls didnt really seem to have the part just right but they still make me laugh it was a really great movie and a great mystery i definitely recommend watching it,1,1,positive,
youre waiting to see if the remake is better or worse i rated the audie murphy movie a 3 im a harsh grader the second lowest i ever gave audie the worst being battle at bloody beach if youre curious i give this movie a rating of 8 and im a harsh grader its the civil war story of renegade soldiers if you want to call them that against the north people like quantrell and the men who rode with these outlawsthe original was a watery version very clean cut while still depicting the horror of what these men did actually movies such as the older version are best viewed by mature audiences who can discern the story i would be more apt to rate the original r and this one with its gruff nature a gp because the newer movie gives a very honest version a message more easily deciphered by a juvenile than the older versionfilm makers since the early sixties have boasted about realism but few of them deliver instead they just give the drab scenery drab costumes and drab events but with comic book cardboard stereotype characters the weakness of the spaghetti eramodern film makers have realized this mistake it is evident in a superior style of western we usually see today this movie is an example it gives the realistic settings but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that erait has a few lulls which makes a complete sit through a bit hard and it has some unexplained situations but unexplained situations are okay as long the entire movie holds up and the characters are intriguing enoughit begins a bit campy but really improves the main character is one we can identify and at least have some sympathy for the audie murphy character of the early movie really evokes no sympathy and is too self righteous without motivationthe character in this movie follows the lines of a true antihero there is motivation and a method to his madness we never feel he is truly right but we can understand where he comes fromthere is plenty of action in the movie there is also some humor one good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she wouldnt lie to him and he mulls that overthis movie succeeds in doing what film makers have been trying to do for decades this director and writer team got it rightrecommended complete success,1,0,positive,

this production never really got off the ground for me the plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless youve read the novel or seen a better adaptation like the 1995 one with amanda root youre going to be a bit lost since theres no time for character developmenti liked sally hawkins as anne but the rest of the cast fell rather short of what they should have been mrs croft was far too old as was annes elder sister elizabeth mary uttered everything in such throbbing accents that the general peevishness and selfishness of her character was lost much better was sophie thompsons mary whose selfishness and sense of illusage is so well established that by the time wentworth suggests anne stay with the injured louisa and mary objects that she as louisas sister in law should stay instead you cant imagine anyone less suited to do so in this version she might as well stay as she is insufficiently differentiated from anyone else in the productionrupert penryjones is nice to look at but he made a much better st john rivers 1995 jane eyre probably because that character required less implied depth of feeling i agree with the comments made earlier about the gig scene seemed more like he was trying to get rid of anne than do her a favor likewise the accident scene it happens so fast and with so little context you wonder what all the fuss is about and moving the speech that wentworth overhears in the novel to the beginning of this production is a critical misstep that only contributes to the disjointed nature of the script my other problem with this version was the lighting sometimes everything looked like a scene from the csi morgue very very blue other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well like when anne visits her old school friend mrs smith who by the way is supposed to be more or less paralyzed having her run up to anne on the street to tell her of mr elliots awful character was such a violation that for a minute i couldnt think who she was i thought she was one of the musgrove girls and she might as well have been all the girls were pretty much interchangeable and the running scene at the endin an era where propriety was at a premium its hard to imagine gentle anne tearing all over bath like some demented hoyden how silly can you get its too bad sally hawkins had all the makings of a good anne elliot but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an overtruncated production,0,0,negative,
i have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further nothing about this film worked absolutely nothing delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise exjailbird at the same time her friend hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her she also happens to be sleeping with marlon who is desperately in love with her then theres delmars brother jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father on the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film so far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life death grief and love in the first half the film simply loses direction if the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed for instance why does delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife why is hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesnt love her how is it missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight is jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems or is missy the exception has delmar and jethros mother always been on the eccentric side or is it a more recent development why is jethro so keen on cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room why did moses spend years in prison for stealing a car a relatively minor crime how does delmar manage to end up giving birth to moses baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex these questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered i can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script big mistake losing several subplots especially the hortense and marlon story which adds nothing to the overall film would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the delmar jethro and moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all including jorja fox who does her best to rise above the material im not surprised that this appears to have been the directors last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story,0,-1,positive,

i watched the dvd of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track in english it seems in cambodia the subtitles in english say the character is speaking thai but the movie says cambodiaa very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill he sends pang to kill some people in china and during the killings a cops partner is killed the cop wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma wais chief is his dads friend and is worried about wais erratic behavior he doesnt know wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father wont let her leave pang doesnt speak chinese and doesnt understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for cat iii wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting pang but pang is almost unstoppable even after pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant wai follows and joins the evil man whos training the boysmaking a deal to fight and train so he can get pang there is a big showdown between wai and pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving wai dead and pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer this film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack there are many very brutal violent scenes the woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot knives to the neck and torso guns fired directly to the head and several very intense beatings it maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing,1,1,positive,
this movie is like the thousand cat and mouse movies that preceded it the following may look like a spoiler but it really just describes a large class of movies there is the passionate wise main character his goofy but wellmeaning sidekick with his illplaced attempts at humorous comments the initiallyhostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable unlikely love story the loved ones taken hostage and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions everybody has seen tons of these movies already and national treasure is like any one of them with only a slightly modified wrapping every turn of the story was easily predicted and i can assure you i am not the sharpest tool in the shed i am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a hollywood movie and if you have ever felt that way too heed my warning stay miles away from this movie,0,-1,positive,

unfortunately due to a sluggish start i cant say that this is one of hitchs best films it very excellent none the less the film stars jimmy stewart and doris day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back they both give excellent performances not surprising of course really however i was most impressed with hitchcocks amazing use of music the climax at the opera house was fantastic and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene also the use of doris day singing que sera sera was excellent especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film so this film to me ends up being hitchcocks best use of music that i have seen to date unfortunately it had a slow start or i could have recommend this film a little more highly even then it is still well worth a look 8 out of 10,1,1,positive,

scott bartletts offon is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a fullfrontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsyinducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avantegarde cinema theres no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey 1968 and indeed bartletts opening sequence of images flashing colours before a closeup human eye recalls dave bowmans journey through the stargate the visuals are richlycoloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video as though were sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitorthere appears to be some confusion about the films release date imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music wouldnt have gone amiss either offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought and please dont laugh at this freethinking interpretation that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that couldnt possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality,1,-1,neutral,

eye in the labyrinth is not your average gialloand to be honest im not really sure that it really is a giallo but giallo or not despite some problems this is certainly a very interesting little film im hesitant to call it a giallo because the film doesnt feature most of the things that make these films what they are but many genre entries break the mould and this would seem to be one of them the film doesnt feature any brutal murders as many giallos do but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration the plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by julie his patient who for some reason she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her we then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before julies arrivalthe film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth this never really comes off and i preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point if any the film is trying to make eye in the labyrinth is directed by mario caiano the director behind the excellent night of the doomed some years earlier he doesnt create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one but the surreal aspects of the story come off well and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring the film stars rosemary dexter who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance most of the rest of the cast arent really worth mentioning with the exceptions of adolfo celi who is good as the villain of the piece and alida valli whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks the film does explain itself at the end which is lucky as im sure im not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then overall this may not be classic stuff but its good enough and worth seeing,1,-1,positive,

this movie was a rather odd viewing experience the movie is obviously based on a play now im sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesnt feel terribly interesting enough to watch the movie is way too stagey and they didnt even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie instead what is presented now is an almost literally refilming of a stageplay with overthetop characters and staged dialog because of all this the storyline really doesnt work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore and obsolete viewing experienceit takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy youre watching at first you think its a drama youre watching with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses youll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy that leans really more toward the comedy genre rather than the drama genrethe characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and overthetop one that at times really become unwatchable sure the actors are great peter otoole and susannah york amongst others but they dont really uplift the movie to a level of watchable enoughthe story feels totally disorientated basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brothersister characters played by peter otoole and susannah york but what exactly is the story even about the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer like i said before im sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isnt fitting and simply doesnt work outthe editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences more was to expect from director j lee thompson who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed stageplay translated to screen projectreally not worth your time410,0,-1,positive,

god that sucked you cant end a horror movie with a happilyeverafter family setting yeash i was kind of ambivalent going in to the final act but my god he didnt have to kill the girl she didnt die the ghost father appears with a cure which makes no sense because his spirit would have been liberated after the yank kid killed all the bad werewolves what a hunk of junk this is the worst horror movie ive seen in a long time and ive watched a lot of horror movies this is a slap in the face for landis and everyone else involved in american werewolf in london blegh i hope that this ruined the career of every one in it bar julie delphy and cgi kind of new and chic back in 1997 but today it just looks drab compared to the artful prostheticmakeup work of london anyway im done i hope ive scared a few people of get the original instead or failing that the howling or failing that watch american idol reruns just dont watch this mess,0,0,negative,
this comment may technically contain spoilers but it sure doesnt contain surprisesmy cousin and i rented this the other day hoping to get a good laugh at a typical amateur crappy excuse for a horror movie unfortunately we didnt get too many laughs and we certainly didnt get too many scares eitherplot outline a plane containing a company heads daughter and some weird piece of technology crashes in an area where our furry friend lives so the company head assembles a team of personalities rather than skilled hunters to recover itfor the first 34s of the movie things get pretty boring it mostly consists of shots of big foot lurking in the trees with the party members occasionally hearing him and passing it off as nothing we also see several shots of the party through big foots point of view and he apparently sees in thermal visionto set up the plot we have to watch sequences of the group sitting around the campfire talking about possibilities to justify the sasquatches existence and actions maybe he can dodge bulletsif he sees them coming sure enough we later see he can there are many uncharted lands that the sasquatch may live in maybe this is one of them that was overlooked and obviously it is maybe the sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members and sure enough thats the case along with those scenes there are a couple of oh my god its the sasquatch oh wait its just you scenes and sadly they are among the scariestthen finally people start dying well 2 people at least plus the bodies of past victims are discovered the death scenes are pretty lame it mostly just leaves it to our imagination by showing the sasquatch grabbing them then cutting to a different scene but first we are treated to some horrible screams off camerathen at last we get to see the protagonists final showdown with the monster i gotta admit i found it pretty exciting while it lasted but alas its pretty short lived and after we are treated to an ending that makes a half assed effort to seem cryptic then some closing text with a rather boring conclusioni cant say i recommend this movie its not quite bad enough to give the mystery science theatre 3000 and its definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie just dont bother with it,0,0,negative,
yes some people have said that this movie was a waste of money but im the kind of die hard dragonworldendingholy crap action movie fanbut if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good but its that kind of movie that everything just fell tougher at the right time or just about when evil was trumph something fell in to save them at the right time though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised methe 3d graphics were pretty damn good i mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were great big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had the fight between good and evil at the end was i have to to say could have been longer and slightly better it was still pretty goodnow on to the parts that i think could have been better the beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles i mean if you dont really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a dvderoverall i loved the moviebut the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well,1,1,positive,
this is quite a bad movie but oh well this movie is at least not as lame as the third ghoulies movieyes this is a bad movie in terms of its writing directing acting and basically everything in between it has such a weak simple and ridicules story that besides has little to do with the previous ghoulies movie entries it tries to connect the movie with the first movie ghoulies from 1985 but then on the other hand if they really wanted to connect this movie with its predecessors then were are the ghoulies in this movie instead now we are having some small people played by tony cox and arturo gil dressed up as demons not that the ghoulies from the previous movies were any classic characters but they were nevertheless the heart and soul of the movie and also provided the movies with a certain amount of fun its like having a gremlins movie without the gremlinsthe movie is not really interesting to watch because it lacks any tension good humor intriguing characters and basically everything else you can think off because it got put together by persons who obviously arent the most talented ones within their business just like at directors jim wynorski resume with movies such as the witches of breastwick and its sequel alabama jones and the busty crusade house on hooter hill scream queen hot tub party the bare wench project and the sequels the bare wench project 2 scared topless and the bare wench project 3 nymphs of mystery mountain and the da vinci coed on it yeah the movie is quite silly and campy but this is not really enough to boost this movie and gives it some more entertainment value you know its the kind of cheap looking movie with some lame special effects costumes makeup and actors nobody has heard of ever sincestill it isnt the worst movie out of the series because of the reason that ghoulies iii ghoulies go to college is by far a more worse movie since that one had some horrible lame attempts at humor this movie at least still does some attempts to be serious and professional one even though the end result is far from perfectbad movie making and perhaps only watchable for those who have seen the previous ghoulies entries310,0,0,positive,
i see alot of movies at the cinema 103 so far this year and i have to say that this is by far and away the best film i have seen this year even though it was released back in 1954i sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that i had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print the best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist pure quality although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humournot many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort if you ever get a chance to see this movie please do not hesitate its a classic,1,-1,positive,
being a huge horror movie fan one of the most difficult things to be considering the lack of abundance of good movies in the genre and having seen hundreds of them in my lifetime i have to say that dracula 3000 is by far the most uninspired lame and poorly done piece of trash i have had the misfortune to see stay away from this movie its so bad its not even laughable the special effects did i say special were probably achieved spending a couple of grand the acting is terrible and the script should have ended up in the trash bin after the first read by the studio that decided to take on this miserable project the whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse also for you guys out there who like nudity in your movies dont be fooled by the r rating if youre thinking you get a chance to see erika eleniak even halfnaked youre wrong she is fully clothed throughout the entire movie and the cover art is completely misleading there is no scene in any part of the movie that even marginally resembles the awesome cover art they put on the box to draw unsuspecting horror fanstoo bad the rating is only 1 to 10 i would give this movie a 10 be warned dont waste your money or your time on this one,0,0,positive,

the other is a supposed horror movie made during the 1970s it is not to be confused with the similarly titled the others which starred nicole kidmanthe plot is as follows a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as the game one of these twin boys niles is supposed to be good the other one holland is supposed to be evilthe idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to endthe execution of this movie is very much like a tv movie of the kind uk residents might see on channel 5 in fact this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this tv channel a slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a urated movie of the kind disney produce but even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by the otheryou dont need to check out the directors cv to realise horror is not his fortemr mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story this is obvious from the getgo i havent seen any of his other movies but to kill a mockingbird is a highly regarded crime movie on this site unfortunately in the other the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expectthe direction is as bland as you could possibly find almost every single scene takes place in the daytime think about this a scene shot in the open landscape in rural america during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area does it sound scary or atmospheric believe me it isnt it comes across as something more akin to an episode of little house on the prairie than a horror movie and yes both the aforementioned tv series and the other were shot in californiathere is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointlessthe ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period i wont reveal which movie but ill give 2 clues a young boy was a main character and the movie is wellknown and ill add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter moviethe acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why i have awarded 2 stars the actors playing the twin boys along with the actress playing the grandmother all try hard with the poor material they are givendiana muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list she gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cashin on her long established tv career in order to help attract tv viewersi paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the dvd cover of the region 2 version in the uk comparisons were made to the exorcist which i thought was a complete insult to that movie there is no comparison the exorcist had everything this movie should contain but does not suspense tension tongueincheek humour highly disturbing content great acting superb characterisation and viewer involvement ironically the exorcist was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as the other the other comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s let alone the 1970sthe 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as the exorcist the omen the texas chainsaw massacre the legend of hell house salems lot to name just a few being produced for this reason the other proves an even greater disappointmentif anyone finds the synopsis of the other interesting they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about i would advice everyone to skip the movie,0,-1,positive,
beautifully made with a wonderful performance from gretchen moll capturing such a stainless plain happiness in her work and the recreations of the little movies and the photographs are perfectly made and often hilarious according to harron they used film stock that is no longer produced and fifties style studio lighting even for the outside locations to give the colour portions its distinctive look bettie page saw the movie at hugh heffners house she is now eightythree with the producers there but not the director in case it got awkward if she didnt like it she apparently did like it up until the official inquiry which she found unsettling some great costumes too the idea for the movie started in 1993 but this was worth the wait the portrait of her never seems to ring false in reference to all those images and snippets of dreadful movies that many of us will have already seen it would make an interesting companion piece with goodnight and goodluck but much more pleasant viewing,1,1,positive,
betty sizemore renee zellweger lives her life through soap opera a reason to love as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life after a shocking incident involving two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock betty goes into shock and travels to la believing that she is destined to marry the shows main character greg kinnearnurse betty is that rare thing a lesser known film with an allstar cast and a fluffy romcom plot that surprises with its terrific script and spot on acting indeed such a plot makes one question the r rating but its warranted all right the shocking incident that sends betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie but at the same time it is necessary to believably show bettys transformation into the doe eyed lovable nut job she becomesas we go along with betty on her journey director neil labute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error an example of this would be bettys first meeting with her crush she pours her heart out to him and he plays along thinking shes auditioning for a part on the show even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of bettys ramblings the music swells as she speaks giving us the audience bettys emotional perspective we almost believe what she is saying yet we understand that her mind is fractured whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene labute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understandingthe banter between the hit men played by freeman and rock is priceless the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of freeman in particular is excellent as always pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of betty not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her aaron eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of bettys nogood husband and he is almost unrecognisable the other revelation here is kinnear whose portrayal of the soaps star is not too overcooked theres a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard clich as thickly as possible and kinnear resists instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance despite simply being a soap starthe soap opera is realised so well it could almost exist labute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too if the soap opera had been too satirical a large part of the film would not have worked to do a days of our lives spoof as seen in friends would have been the wrong move for this movie the dedication to detail pays off as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into bettys reality more and more while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre the scenes on the set feel real as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured you wondered why people who do it for a living cant get it rightthe neat resolution of the final act while being a tad predictable is wholly satisfying overall its a shame that after labute directed this wonderful film the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of the wicker man a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him unfortunately one cannot absolve him of all responsibilityif you havent seen nurse betty its something to discover if you have its worth a revisit there is a charm to nurse betty that is infectious even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards a hidden gem nonetheless,1,1,positive,

i was really looking forward to seeing this movie having spent a few fantastic college weeks in barcelona myself the premise is right on cuea confused disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused disordered young individuals but the directors weak swats at symbolism philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark and it leaves us the audience feeling confused disordered bravoperhaps if this movie had been presented as a european american pie flick then id be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride but right off the bat the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the inner self vs the public self ones mother tongue vs ones secondary language furthermore it dives boldly into the subject of racialnational stereotyping off to an interesting start ehwrong thats as far as it goes these interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epiloguetype ending which seemed to be the directors way of floundering to get back on topic it reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere but the speaker ends by saying so in conclusion i hope you see how this relates to my original thoughtfurthermore as other reviewers have pointed out the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself if the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes then why did the director introduce a cockneyspeaking beerswilling english brat as a caricature of prejudice why did the director portray the american as a neanderthal literally banging his chest making ape noises at one point whilst the europeans tolerate him superciliously why is the british girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs calling french people frogs and butchering the french language while everyone else is above all that the answer is that this isnt a deep or wellthought out film its simply an anglophobes retort to the anglophiles but really its no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule now theres a funny irony to considerok philosophy artistry sociopolitical commentary aside i was still very bored by this movie there is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls boyfriends but aside from that i was hardly entertained at all the only reason why i watched it through to the end is that id like to brush up on my french spanish you see we monolingual americans may be stupid but we do try,0,1,positive,

anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that i love bad movies almost as much as i love great ones and i can honestly say that i have finally seen one of the alltime legendary bad movies the almost indescribable mess that is myra breckinridge an adaptation of gore vidals bestselling book he later disowned this film version the starstudded myra breckinridge is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end the xrated movie about sex change operations and hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of its release not surprisingly the film went on to gain a nearlegendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema and i was actually quite excited to finally see for the first timedirector michael sarne who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time took a lot of flack for the finished film and in honesty it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve the film is often incoherent with entire sequences edited together in such a halfhazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals this means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as judy garland and shirley temple laced into newlyfilm scenes of often lewd sexual acts and the process just doesnt work as intended this also caused a minor uproar as actors such as temple and loretta young sued the studio for using their image without permissionperhaps sarne is not the only one to blame however as the films screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief for instance this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic rex reed in his first and last major film role could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess raquel welch the film becomes further hard to follow when welch as myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle played by legendary film director john huston seduce a nubile female film student farrah fawcett and teach the schools resident bad boy roger herren a lesson by raping him with a strapon dildo did everyone follow that and it gets even better or worse depending upon your perspective i have yet to mention the films topbilled star the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteenthirties mae west ms west was 77 year old when she appeared in this film she had been retired for 26 years and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men including a young tom selleck throwing themselves at her as if this werent bad enough the tonedeaf west actually performs two newlywritten songs about halfway through the film and i think that i might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them naturally none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as good but i would give myra breckinridge a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when i had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on also most of the cast tries really hard raquel in particular appears so hellbent in turning her poorlywritten part into something meaningful that she singlehandedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching if she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form criticsthe rest of the cast is also fine the endearingly overthetop john huston who really should have been directing the picture has some funny moments rex reed isnt bad for a nonactor and farrah fawcett is pleasantly freshfaced and likable roger herren is also fine but he never appeared in another movie again after this i guess he just couldnt live down being the guy who was rapped by raquel welch and as anyone could guess from the description above mae west was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie but thats part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema,0,0,positive,

and i do not understand why the show gets so much beating in my opinion this show really is excellent well the first two episodes were not that great but it picks up a load of momentum at the third episode which seems to be typical for a steve moffat sitcom i would rate it among the best sitcoms britain has ever producedthe show itself is a farce at its best it is not along the lines of fawlty towers but you definitely can rank it as high as a black adder coupling or the young ones i am watching the first season and all i can say is that i am happy i bought the dvdthe problem probably with this show is and why it got smacked so hard according to the internet that the original press release compared it to fawlty towers and everyone was disappointed it was not well even green wing is closer to fawlty towers than this show all i can say is clear your mind from every prejudice give the show at least a run until including episode 3 and then decide for yourselfall i can say is thanks steve moffat for writing it and thanks for the entire staff pulling it off,1,1,positive,
i really loved this original screenplay and the different places it took me emotionally spiritually and just plain silly stuff i didnt get caught up in believability in the screenplay or the actors and didnt even think about it until reading the reviews listed here in imdb for the movie listening to michael parness talk at the q a about his idea of the film wanting to see how crazy people or fed up people as he put it fall in love is really interesting i identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at its best i like watching david krumholtz in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now i believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone just see this film to watch an amazing young actor i agree that guillermo daz really was a scene stealer and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in commitment i laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it didnt win any awards at the festival i question why that didnt happen i gave max and grace a ten because these interesting unique creative indie films deserve an audience technically watching this film its really beautifully done the colors are amazing and lastly its one of the best soundtracks i have heard in a film in awhile,1,1,positive,

i can only agree with many observers that traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television i saw traffik when it was on tv and i have just watched it again i am particularly moved by the haunting original music of tim souster and especially by the dolorous strains of dmitri shostakovichs chamber symphony in c minor the music over the credits and in parts of the film the music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad fate the music is powerfully emotional this arrangement combines two of the movements from the symphony but i recommend listening to the symphony per se,1,-1,neutral,
sunny a cocktail waitress in the dc area is a bit dim to put in mildly she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple however she saves the life of a prominent arab by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks sniffing an opportunity presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the us government even then she messes things up at times but she tries hard and learns a lot she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official but is there another sinister plot in the making involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife a blonde one lol lol lol this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb as a fox as they say sunny learns her way around the jungle of the us government very very well she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings perhaps the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work but for those who like to laugh rent this today,1,-1,neutral,

first off anyone looking for meaningful outcome oriented cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated emotive heartfelt thespians please leave now you are wasting your time and life is short go see the new brangelina jolie movie have a good cry go out buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better and leave us alonedont let the door hit you on the way out either the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young tv friendly cast crew and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects wakes up in a hospital and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump the melting man is played by one alex rebar who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film but once he starts oozin with rick bakers extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny viscous blebs of greasethe film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care really its a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out hilariousthe hero of the film is played by burr debenning a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype slightly twisted neurotic and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead or the alien zone that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma which is where i suspect this film was made as well the arid cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning which also had a sick sense of humor a tv friendly cast and some pretty outrageous gore i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting mans castessentially as others have pointed out this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects the inevitable boobs the movie it probably borrows most of its ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting mans motivations he simply goes on a rampage and the movies drama comes from wondering if hes going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen rick bakers disgusting effects getting the lions share of whatever was spent on thissick disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer why cant people have made more movies like these 810,1,1,positive,

with a cast list like this one i expected far better venessa redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed the best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie the plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death the thing is she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy all the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped i also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary it seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the da vinci code in which the device was used to increase suspense or from the notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the storys main characters either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didnt work to create anything it was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none i left wondering why good movies cant be written for women it really was a disappointment,0,-1,positive,

bad personal opinion the folks who made it they knew that when they made it to star in this movie again my opinion you needed to meet three criteria 1 you had to own your own goth style clothing and jewelry makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way 2 you had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards note that i didnt say you had to do it well saves on time and paper work 3 you had to be willing to get naked gives an r rating and thus bolsters sales want to watch a better movie easy get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself trust me you wont do any worse as vampire movies go well this one sucks and a hint here for people like me who like to look for little oddities in movies consider the link between vampires and crosses now take a look at the symbols and names on the headstones in the cemetery portions of this thing were filmed in ed wood couldnt have planned that kind of an accident any better himself,0,0,negative,

reading some of the other reviews of this film i was reminded of both good and not so good aspects of it but overall i have to say it is one of the better films i have seen from any number of genres or countries recently more than anything else it avoided many of the typical traps of more recent international cinema like taking nice pictures of landscapes or being hip fun or imitating american films like pulp fiction the film is unique in many ways for one thing it is a film about relationships in which sex plays no role unusual especially for foreign films it is also a film about two mens relationship to each other also unusual not a buddy film no homosexual tension no egophallic competition it uses little dialogue but communicates a tremendous amount it is a simple story yet full of complex details which are easily understood by any human being and universal in their relevance i did not find the film dark or depressing everything would seem this way if you watch hollywood happy ending films all the time but rather a true reflection of human emotions for instance in the scene where mahmut realizes his cousin is gone is you see both his feeling of relief that the cousin is gone and yet regret that he pushed him away who has not felt such ambivalence when losing a friend or lover or in some other situation its rare to get these kinds of real human emotions displayed on film in a nonclich way as far as culture is concerned or this being a turkish film i feel it strikes the very difficult balance between being a turkish film about realities which more apply to that place the greater struggle to make it in a turkish city versus a european one the greater contrast between country and city and a universal human story which didnt necessarily have to be set in turkey in this day and age where people around the world are consuming culture and fetishizing it this film does not try to entice us as turkish nor does it try to communicate it as a harsh reality or thats how turkeyistanbul is and yet the cultural elements are there i think the comparison to lost in translation that somebody made is quite good everyone at least in the us was raving about that film i personally thought it was mediocre at best it was well put by someone as a vague story which supposedly was supposed to deal with disorientation that happens to people living or traveling overseas even if the film was supposed to be humorous the characters and their motivations or crises were never clear even for a lighter film or comedy this is necessary and i found myself being treated to a typically orientalist story of the alienated amerian overseas going back to distant as for the idea that this is bad acting or too slow or has no plot im sorry but people who say this know nothing about film making and maybe nothing about being human no offense you do not have to be a film aficionado or cultural connoisseur to appreciate this film this film will be two hours of your time well spent,1,-1,positive,
minor spoilersyou know its getting to the point where walt disney television animation might just as well be called walt disney sequel animation these sequels range from excellent beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas and the fantastic lion king ii simbas pride to horrible the return of jafar this is of course my personal opinion now disney brings us their latest sequel scamps adventure and while it is flawed it is still entertainingthe quality of animation is not up to par with disney feature animation still the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life lady and tramp have not aged a day since 1955 trusty still talks about his sense of smell and ol reliable and jock still gives him grief about it theres a nice fight between tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessori really dont care for most of the songs though roger bart and susan eganthe singing voices of scamp and angelsing their parts very nicely both melissa manchester and norman gimbel have done much better work in the past danny troobs score is okay but nothing memorable and some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage that is they really dont do muchthe voice work on the other hand is quite good while i dont like jeff bennett as the dogcatcher he is very good as tramp chazz palminteri does a nice job as buster leader of the junkyard gang and alyssa milano gives what may be her best performance as angel then there is scamp who is the spitting image of his dad he is voiced to perfection by scott wolf wolf does a superb job of showing scamps wild streak and his soft sideall in all while scamps adventure is flawed it still makes for rather entertaining viewing it is my hope however that walt disney television animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases,1,1,positive,

a nicely evoked 1930s setting provides much interest for a viewer in the early 21st century unfortunately london belongs to me has little else to recommend it besides lashings of quaint english charm all of the problems rest with the deeply unfocused story the main plot concerns the actions of young lad richard attenborough the problems he gets into and how the community in which he lives bands together to save him from societys laws or something the main issue here is that attenboroughs character brings everything upon himself and quite frankly is guilty of almost every accusation brought against him so its baffling why the film and all the characters have so much sympathy for him hes treated as a victim of circumstance when he really really isnt and whats more he isnt shown to have very much remorse for his actions only caring about getting away with things he didnt mean to do alastair sim gets a lot of screen time in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot line and you wonder what hes doing there though sim is as always superb you know theres a problem with the structure when the main plot impacts constantly against the subplot but not viceversa and following a sedate pace and a careful build up the plot completely falls apart in the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfying and unexplained conclusion which doesnt even show us if attenboroughs character has developed at all from the previous proceedings the film doesnt end it just stopsthe acting direction and the general feel of the film can all be commended but unfortunately the story and structure of the piece jars constantly a last point of trivia alec guinness based his performance in the vastly superior film the ladykillers on alastair sims performance in this film right down to both the characters having almost identical first scenes,0,1,neutral,

i came to new port south expecting a surrogate movie about the columbine school massacre similar to gus van sants elephant and certainly the synopsis in the tv guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned the story is about maddox a chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime the major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him blake shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies you have the gut feeling that maddox should have the evil charisma of hitler saddam or bin laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and its impossible to believe he could rally any disciples the subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means new port south is an entirely unconvincing drama thats not worth going out of your way to see,0,0,negative,
i went and saw rivers and tides again today its the second time in two days and yes i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthys works this morning when i threw the coins i received 29 the abysmal water goldsworthy has an affinity with water hence the title i received the 5th line changing which moved to 7 the army to blake art was a war anyway i knew i had to see the film againi read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner the critic loved the film but said goldsworthys comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film hed rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack so i was aware of that as i watched this second timeyesterday i thought that id vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say could i enjoy the film without his comments what he is doing what he is saying goes way beyond art his understanding of water time stone change and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar some of his workwords are zen like his knowledgeanyway the film is only apparently being shown here in the bay area be a trend setter go to your local cinema and tell them no insist that they have to book a film youve heard about from the hinter lands its called rivers and tides,1,1,positive,
to start this movie was sick here your wife is dying and you go strutting around town with this blond chic by your side then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic hank james brolin is definitely moving fast throughout this movie i called him fast hank fast hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it she is having sex with his best friends the part that gets me is when she is doing it in the barn with kevin and gets caught by another one of hanks friends kevin gets up and leaves she drops her robe and bam right into the arms of this other guy and they start doing it right then and there i guess he is finishing up what kevin started how gross i am like this is lifetime movie its a typical old man young woman movie that says you can have my body if i get your money,0,-1,positive,
i was intrigued by the title so during a small bout of insomnia fueled by my curiosity i stayed up and watched it i then checked my tv listings and watched it again there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film in spite of politics traditions culture etc teenagers everywhere are virtually the same the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to lets say somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period and language differences aside would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations politics aside music sex movie idols music drinking sports music as a matter of fact much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970s southern californiathis was a bittersweet story but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable the characters especially the young actors were completely believable also i wont say this was the yugoslav american graffiti but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50sthemed movies,1,-1,neutral,
i saw into pitch black on tv and so i had to see this i must say i was very impressednot only has david twohys style improved since he wrote critters 2 this film brought to my attention vin diesel sure he was there in into pitch black but here he was ferocious scary and intense i havent seen charisma like that since schwarzenegger in the 80sthe story is simple enough but it is the characters that make this film interesting then there was what happens with the female lead unexpected the dark humor helps the film move along the effects arent grand but when riddick fights the alien it blew all of my complaints outdiesel hasnt done a whole lot since this film that i would care about but i am eagerly looking forward to the sequel,1,-1,neutral,
time and time again ive stated that if people dont want remakes or sequels made they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film having said that though the last time i saw an independent film myself must have been easily six months ago so heres a review for an indie that i had my attention drawn to on youtube the cureright away you can tell that the film is going for an avantgarde film approach which is telegraphed in its use of extreme close ups scopophilia and fast editing it is proud of the way it looks and it has a right to be for the most part it is a very nicely composed little piece save for one inexcusable disregard for the 180 degree rule and a comically bad gunshot effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self funded projectsstill despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at were presented with a good use of props and locations good visual acting and some very atmospheric fluid editing which is made more commendable as this is definitely something you wont see very often at all from a youtube submission the plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening but what we are seeing here is avantgarde storytelling at work you cant really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of moviewhere the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound what youre going to hear throughout is a distorted voiceover which often sounds insincere and worse still is the continuous background music which goes through minimal change and doesnt add much to anything so much attention is paid to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected and this becomes really apparent when you realize youve just missed about four sentences of the narration and have to backtrack to pick up what slipped past your attentionso give it a watch but do it with the sound turned offlast thought was anyone else reminded of the cover for doug naylors red dwarf novel last human early in the film if you have the book you know what i mean,1,0,negative,
saw in on tv late last night yeah i can hear what yall say about this one it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo typical tv soap series in all fairness the story line does have a fine twist to it and you might nod saying well thats not what i expected but as a film well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element casting acting camera work cars costume setting script no theres nothing to congratulate rated r oh that scene did we need it this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched and what was the title again,0,-1,neutral,
ego seems its the only reason this movie was made this movie is so wrong in so many ways that its below ones dignity to write much about it every character was only good at self praise and lead actors i use this term liberally as has the director emote in the likeness of stone the little story if that fails on the basic aspects such as logic feeling and drama direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are all over the place character motives arent defined prospective husbands are found overnight broken car windows mend themselves among other thingslets face it himesh cant act neither it seems can hansika motwani in her defense shes still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of makeup raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much the actor who plays himeshs friend is the only natural a few questions do come to mind how can such a film cost rs500000000 where did the money go granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs15000000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind including 3 mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police carthe good himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark topi lets give the devil his due himesh as usual gives good musicthe bad direction story himeshs singing is still hard to ignorethe ugly dialogs and everything elsefinal word painful in every sense of the word watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghais yaadein,0,0,positive,
this movie will undoubtably not go over well with some because most of the horror is mental but it does have a little something for almost everyone including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with aliens the film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology while also showing a bit more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than you would expect out of a movie jillian mcwhirter is excellent in what had to have been a grueling performance,1,1,positive,

i am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the so bad its good type of viewing however i really like this film for its fun factor and believe it or not its innovationthe whole thing has a ring of john waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements billy zane moves with incredible expression see the scene on the bus for a textbook lesson in how to use movement and is framed by some unexpected starsyou may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars highly reccomended,1,-1,negative,
one of my favorite westerns and one of john fords best in my opinion no major stars but ben johnson shines in most everything he appears and here he gets a rare lead as the title character matching him is ward bond as the crusty mormon elder leading his people west john fords stock of character actors including harry carey jr jane darwell russell simpson and hank worden provide ample support as does eerily silent james arness a member of the outlaw clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train the mormon trail into utah was one of the most arduous and demanding enterprises ever undertaken we cant really get the feel of that but we do see ordeals that had to be overcome by pioneers on the way west river crossings long stretches of dry waterless desert encounters with indians and the like all set to glorious song by the sons of the pioneers the mormons actually did dig sections of the trail with picks and shovels as depicted in the movie my main regret is that it wasnt made in color but i believe there is a colorized version by the way those craggy rocks featured in various scenes are called the fisher towers located near moab highly recommended viewing,1,-1,positive,

so on the chills network on cable they are having vampire month im such a dork but i love vampires so after a few duds that they showed i was pretty disappointed but then i noticed sleepwalkers was written by stephen king so i decided to go ahead and check it out well much to my surprise this movie was really bad most stephen king films are entertaining and some are very scary while sleepwalkers was bad it was a beautiful kind of bad i had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was ive never read sleepwalkers from what i understand this is the only real vampire story by king so i cant really compare book to film i dont know if it was just my tv but sleepwalkers looked like it was made for tv the special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched even if it is fantasy it had a lot of problems charles brady and his mother mary are vampires who feed off the life force of virgin women they are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both telekinesis and illusion their one weakness is cats who are not only able to see through their illusions but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them they also maintain an incestuous relationship charles and mary have taken up residence in a small indiana town charles attends the local high school and there he meets tanya robertson in his creative writing class tanya does not suspect the real reason why charles wants her so much to take her life force for his mother who is starving at first it seems that charles has fallen in love with tanya on their first date however a picnic at the nearby cemetery charles attempts to drain the life force from tanya while kissing her as it happens deputy sheriff andy simpson who had earlier tried to pull charles over for speeding drives by the cemetery and notices charles car when tanya runs to him for help charles tracks andy down and kills him when charles then turns to resume his life forcedepleting make out session with tanya the deputys cat clovis rises to the occasion and nearly kills charles by scratching him in the face and chest mortally wounded by clovis charles staggers back home to mary mary then seeks vengeance on tanyas familyso to sum this movie up basically you should expect the cheese to overflow the scene where charles attacks tanya for the first time is very clich and you almost vote for charles to win just because tanya is one of the dumbest female leads in horror movies then you gotta love the scene where mary has a gun and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explodes god bless hollywood explosions and exaggerations im taking the movie for what it is its just so deliciously bad that it turns into a dark comedy for me that i could just enjoy making fun of im not sure if this is what stephen king wanted to see for his story but he does have his typical cameo in the film so my suggestion if you watch this movie just take it for what it is and dont over think it its mindless entertainment with corny effects bad casting a silly story and enough cats to make the crazy cat lady from the simpsons say wow thats a lot of cats410,0,0,positive,
most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable however because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films a perfect example was the john garfield film air forcein which a b17 nearly singlehandedly takes out half the japanese air force however pride of the marines is a welcome departurescoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner when i first saw this film i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true however after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true,1,1,positive,
this has the funnist jokes out of all the cheech chong flicks its the first one i saw with these guys i found it to be really good my dad actually recommended me to get it what a great role model and my grandma actually bought it for me knowing what it was like what a family i have well this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic i must warn you though this isnt gutbusting funny it has its moments but not as funny as theres something about mary check it out anyway im sure youll laugh unless your an antidrug activist or something,1,1,positive,

a real let down the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for tv movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow stick to mike hammer i find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book kubrick gushes over it on the cover he should have taken over the reins on this one stacey keach is too soppy as lou ford and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies tv spin off of planet of the apes i thoroughly recommend that you go out and buy lots of jim thompson novels though actually the grifters isnt done too badly thats one of his starring jon cusak,0,-1,positive,
from the golden period of british films this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time screened yesterday at my film society to a rapturous audience i was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted made in 1950 it is really down to the expert timing and inimitable playing from two of the finest actors britain has produced margaret rutherford and alastair sim adapted from a play by john dighton this farce is briskly handled by director frank launder the plot is simple a ministry mistake billets a girls school on a boys school i will always laugh when i think of this film,1,-1,neutral,
fabulous film rented the dvd recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work douglas sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of rock hudson dorothy malone oscar winner robert stack oscar nominated and lauren bacall that words cannot describe paul verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having dorothy malone play sharon stones murdering inspirational guru in his basic instinct what a great joke by turns the film is hilarious riveting campy biting trashy compelling and eye rolling its definately the grandaddy of every tawdry bigandlittle screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like youll see here the camera work is smooth and polished the use of color is breathtaking the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable the one dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut while most older highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through written on the wind contains so much and goes by so fast that its actually a shame when it ends thank you to mr sirk for crafting and todd haynes for drawing attention to what has now become one of my favorite films of all time see this movie,1,1,positive,

seriously disappointing performance by brad pitt and q t the plot is very superficial and lame and unless indirectly intended this film actually glorify the nazis and portrays them as men of honor and show that the jewish people are deceiving cant keep promises and bloody vicious the following contains spoiler hitler together with the most notorious nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in paris is unbelievably ridiculous the nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game stupid the deal at the end is lame whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films will not be surprised if it harvested many awards including oscars as well the movie is simply a kissing ass to the jewish people but hey reconsider its not even doing a great job doing that it truly dwarfed the whole nazi jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the nazis,0,-1,positive,
like many people in my general age range i remember going to see this movie as a kid in 98 and coming out of the theatre practically in tears it seemed at the time to be one of the most important aweinspiring cinematic experiences of our generation at once riveting actionpacked funny heartbreaking and truly inspirational armegeddeon really did have everything going on right down to the catchy aerosmith theme song and sappy tearjerker of an endingsweet jebus what were we smoking i watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels and i cannot even describe it this is truly one of the worst movies ever made where to even begin leaving aside the plethora of laughable scientific errors personnel trackers on astronauts yeah sure thanks for that billy bob id have to say the worst thing about it was the remarkable dare i even say unmatched way in which it combined crappy writing with crappy acting there are too many examples of this to even begin listing here but one in particular springs to mind the scene where bruce willis is telling the feds exactly where to go to track down each of the ohsocharminglyroguish members of his oil drilling team check every bar in new orleans the craps tables in vegas the only black guy on a motorcycle in sturgis all to the tune of come together it reminded me a bit of the news team assemble scene from anchorman except serious ben affleck proves once again that he is by far the most overpaid actor in hollywood having less depth range and overall talent than anyone else in the business not that bruce willis liv tyler or anyone else in this godforsaken piece of garbage was much betteri have to say though i got a kick out of seeing a prestardom owen wilson get killed off halfway through is this the only movie where his character dies peter stormare is perfect as the most stereotypical unshaven russian cosmonaut you have ever scene then again peter stormare does seem to have a talent for playing overthetop eurotypes it really was quite amusing how almost immediately after the americans dock with the russian space station which is actually called that in the movie ben affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular hollywood fashion i also love the fact that in the end paris is the only place on earth to get destroyed and that absolutely no one seems to care and on top of all that it at points literally turns into simultaneous ads for lockheed martin and kerr mcgee oh how proud i am to be an americantheres plenty of other stuff to rant about but i wont suffice it to say that this is a really really really terrible movie that i feel ashamed to have ever genuinely likedi give it two stars just for the mockability factor,0,0,positive,
i usually come on this website prior to going to the movies as i like to see what other people think of the movie i read many reviews which said thriller not a horror movie this prompted me to give this film a try i really must take issue with these thrillerhorror statements as it was neither i almost went and asked for my money back and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbishwell you must be easily pleased at the end of the movie the people behind me said out loud what a waste of time and i turned to them and replied i couldnt have summed it up better i kept waiting for something to happenbut it didnt there was the potential for a lot of good scares or thrills if you like but none happened williams acted the part quite well but i felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere save your money folks this is a turkey which will be featuring at a dvd store bargain box near you in the very foreseeable future,0,0,positive,

what can be said of this independent effort beyond the fact that it was shot with television cameras and whether that was by conceit or budget constraints doesnt make the watching of this variation on a theme by romero any easier i was constantly reminded that i was watching somebodys school project at best derivative at worst cheapwriterdirector georg koszulinski who also appears in the film does some interesting things with stock footage but that says more about his editing style than his directing style which consists of inyourface closeups with tv cameras which made me think i was watching publicaccess television instead of an actual honesttogoodness filmthe story copies and pastes bits and pieces from various sources including the aforementioned romeros dead trilogy the road warrior dig that stock footage of a future that looks like the past and the blair witch projectwhat results is an hourandnothings worth of zombies tracking down and eating humans okay the humans in this case are clones but that doesnt change anything its the same menuthe year is 2031 and the first strand of people who were cloned nineteen years before have started to malfunction particularly in the dietary area of course when clones go bad the first thing they have a taste for is human flesh or in this case cloned human flesh its not safe to be indoors its not safe to be outdoors its just a matter of time before the flesheating ghouls devour our heroes have you seen this before i dont mind people ripping off romero if its done well but no new territory is covered in this film its night of the living dead meets the blair witch project shot with television cameras what is particularly disappointing is that the dvd cover makes it look like it was shot at the very least with 8mm film this wouldnt have been a problem with me if the story had not been equally cheap the film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible must we continue to clone our favourite movies,0,0,positive,
the invisible mouse is a delightful and different tom jerrys cartoon it features the usual catmouse chases and battles but in a different way this time jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of surprises for tom scare him torment him and confuse himas much as it is weird its also very cool and funny to see what we cant see jerry invisible its amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing whos doing it we know who right its like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts its equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while hes invisible i really like that instrumental music which plays when hes not visiblesome of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerrys shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes missed me i also like when jerry drinks toms chocolate milk becoming visible again and with a happy look on his faceoverall this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon humor entertainment fun and some nice artwork too,1,-1,positive,
hitler the rise of evil was shrouded in controversy before it ever aired and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the filmthose who criticzed the film which they hadnt seen did so with good intentions based on the misguided thought that it would be overly sympathetic to hitler however they misunderstood the point to humanize the evil hitler is not sympathize with him it is far more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of historys greatest villains were committed by a human being a sick diseased maniac to be sure but a human being nonetheless it is necessary to know the story of how hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening againrise of evil is highlighted by a brilliant career best performance from robert carlyle who makes hitler a human being without ever redeeming him in any way carlyle flawlessly captures the look and mannerisms of the nazi leader while never letting the impersonation become cartoonish or distance us something anthony hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed hitler in the bunker another very good madefortelevision film while were are repulsed by hitlers depravity and virulent antsemitism carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power the real adolf hitler must have possesed after all while else would a nation have followed himof the various subplots by far the most compelling features matthew modine as reporter fritz gehrlich who makes it his lifes work to draw attention to the reality of of hitler and nazism while modines performance is a little stilted in part 1 by part 2 he seems to have settled in the character gives us a reallife hero in a film full of villains peter stormare and liev schrieber also give strong supportpart 1 of this twopart mini series suffered a little bit from being overly choppy including a look at hitlers childhood which lasts only the duration of the opening credits and in part 2 sections detailing hitlers relationships with his niece and his mistress eva braun are less successful than the central plot but do serve to give us further insight into his mental and emotional stateultimately no film about hitler can make us understand him the average person is thankfully incapable of ever understanding a man who would try to exterminate an entire race of people hitler the rise of evil tries less to make us understand hitler and more to make us understand how he came to be power it is an important story that must be told and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would accuse it of having anything but the best of intentions and the capability of doing anything but good9 out of 10 12,1,1,positive,
as i write this no user reviews are in yet but there are 17 votes with a 48 average so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments i didnt notice any and even if i had i dont think i could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate thema common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science police tactics and the like so common in b movies should detract significantly from ones enjoyment i tend to fall into the yes thats a reasonable reaction camp especially when the mistakes are central to the plot with this movie i look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess they completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy police tactics weapons science folklore common sense and human behavior outside of b movies that is in short i cant think of any nontrivial thing they got rightany movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit impervious to all small arms able to disappear into another dimension at will and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion they dont make ghosts like they used to combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie,0,0,negative,
i caught this for the first time a few nights ago on television i expected to only tune in for a few minutes but found myself intrigued by the movie i ended up watching it all and found it surprisingly compelling the acting by the three american leads was quite good especially that of alex cord he plays a gunslinger with quite a degree of vulnerability very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns he ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters the final shootout between the three leads and the bad guys was very good as was the scene where the doctor digs a bullet out of clay mccord somewhat gruesome but realistic i must admit that despite my initial misgivings at watching a spaghetti western i ended up enjoying this film quite a bit i would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns,1,0,negative,
series 2 has got off to a great start i dont think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them and this show makes you think like that these 4 30something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic so the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices,1,1,positive,
the sopranos now preparing to end is the very peak of adult television and drama when the sopranos hits the mark it really hits the mark using great writing and great actors most of them being extras from goodfellas the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way heading up the cast is james gandolfini who for all intensive purposes is tony soprano and edie falco who certainly holds her own the series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary usually violence and foul language tony sirico michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting seasonal extras are also worth note including names like steve buscemi great joe pantoliano great david proval good robert patrick robert loggia and frank vincentthe sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique tv symbolism and simple story lines dreams and shootouts and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect hbo package watch it,1,-1,positive,
having dabbled in the modeling industry as a model i watch this show with a slightly different view than most might while i admit antm can be a fun and entertaining show as the seasons go on it seems to continue to drift from any realitythe show seems to be almost pure publicity for its contestants seeing that none of the shows winners or fellow contestants have made much of a name for themselves out from under of the shows umbrella maybe thats because the truth is any girl with real potential to be a highfashion model shouldnt have too much difficulty submitting to agencies you can do so via email or snail mail if distance prevents you from attending an agency open call signing to an agency and starting a modeling career yes the process does not guarantee success but apparently neither does antm and participating in a reality show seems to offer less of a boost in the modeling business than signing to a top or decent agency which only one contestant each cycle has a guarantee of anywaynonetheless the show cant hurt certainly can be amusing and has a sort of magic that particularly works for teenage girls i have found though i must add antm may become a tad tiring and dull after watching several cycles as it has become for me and besides some unrealistic situations each more outrageous than the last the only other annoyance is the overuse of tyra tyra tyra tyra seems to genuinely want to guide these girls to success but is it necessary for each of models temporary digs to be covered in tyra pictures for virtually every panel and challenge to include a story or scenario that tyra experienced and overcame i think notin my opinion take out a little tyra put back in a little more reality and antm could be a 10 star show instead of a 7,1,-1,neutral,
im not sure what the appeal of this movie is but i couldnt find it its a really long barely credible hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set it doesnt move anywhere the characters are just totally bizarre the underlying plot equally so its lost on me definitely a walk out moviethe one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax and the fact that all irritation aside at the banal personalities theyre acted quite reasonably but you have to brace yourself for endless dialog wishing on many an occasion that teach would just shut the up for a moment,0,-1,neutral,
victor mclaglen the title character of john fords the informer reminded me of the circus man from fellinis la strada anthony quinn played the brutish man who may have even been influenced by the pugfaced oscarwinning performance given by mclaglen povertystricken dublin is the truelife atmospheric setting of the picture which takes place in 1922 dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep irish patriotism and the fight of the irish republican army the conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes the informer tick mclaglens large simple character just wants to go to america and were reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken irishman one is the previous the other a wanted sign should he do it and get the money to gojohn ford once famously said my name is ford i make westerns after seeing this film he obviously could do a heck of a lot more the serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about and the look of the piece is amazing consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable ireland night ford was always known for his luminescent gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters this is hard in color but he did it in pictures like the searchers painting john wayne in a sometimes vicious manner victor mclaglens performance not only benefits from the lighting but by the sheer simplicity of his acting he shoves a lot he knocks people out he is a brute who knows no better he should however know whether or not to cross the irasee the film to find out the gritty details see it also for mclaglen and fords patriotic portrayal of the ira max steiners score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters placing more emphasis on them this was usually only seen in silent films especially chaplin the topic of naming names or informing is obviously still important just look at how the media covered this years oscars giving much attention to the elia kazan scandal,1,1,positive,

i really wanted to like this film but so much of it is stolenborrowed from other work some of the borrowing is painfully blatant the new york times review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous warner brothers cartoon hello my baby hello my darlin hello my ragtime gal but i challenge anyone to watch the foxblue sky animated feature robots 2005 and not find ridiculous similarities in storyline a young inventor growing up and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventionscityscape extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environmentsrobots the servant robot in the robinson household has a very similar design to those in robots and both films use a sort of retrofuturistic lookall of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from disney at the end implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicitythe filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction as though we dont have the attention span for anything lessthe villain is really welldesigned and brilliantly animated and hes a pleasure to watch much of the rest of the film seems throwntogether some of the landscapes look like cgi from the mid90sthe film actually opens with a classic mickey mouse short by the end of this cartoon we are reminded that disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue,0,1,positive,

mario van peebles tries to go the jeanclaude van damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes awol to preserve himself however the government isnt going to take this lying down so among the simplistic plot van peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film this blatant rip off of universal soldier which is far more fun then this simply goes nowhere the main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert van peebles just waits around and there just isnt enough asskicking to justify a viewing on the other hand the movie does sort of resemble a competent version of rotor although where as that abysmal bad movie was hilarious this one only yields occasional laughter in its laughably unconvincing action sequences also like rotor it makes no sense in its narrative and basically the movie is awesomely boring plus the villains are disappointingly weak and basically the movie needs an actual action scenario to work because the material is too dull in all regards solo is a very weak film12 out of 4poor,0,0,positive,
there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building each character unfolds more and more each series also each series has an array of different small time characters as well as the main a good example of a character who was only in three episodes who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick every little detail builds the perfect tv series the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano james gandolfini who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable whilst tony runs things with capos paulie tony sirico and silvio steve van zant his nephew christopher michael imperioli looks for a promotion every episode also features tonys other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano edie falco on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano dominic chianese is trying to get what he can out of tonys businesses despite being under house arrest all the acting is powerful and characters complex but the two who stand out the most are james gandolfini who is tony soprano also michael imperioli who plays christopher representing the younger 2030 generation in crime if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed such as the wire and dexter so the sopranos is definitely the godfather goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv,1,1,positive,
before i saw this film i didnt really expect to much from it although my friend advised otherwise due to this request from my friend i decided i was really going to watch this film the minute i sat down to view the film i was absolutely blown away from the credits i was falling of my seat i just couldnt contain myself the film is about hitler in all the glory of comedy hynkel is the absolute double for the jewish barber who comes back from fighting in the war due to the heroics of the barber he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board which helps in the struggle which the jews had but things went wrong and stolz was arrested but only then to escape to the confines of the jewish surburb the ghetto due to this escape the german army began searching which meant that the barber and stolz got arrested but again they escaped only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently takes his poistion the speech that chaplin makes at the end is fantastic it complies the morals which society could only dream about in the speech it contradicts the whole meaning of the film because of the seriouness and sincerenity which it entailed and it definately works because i did walk out feeling guilty about how we live our lives looking at the smallest thing such as being ignorant to someone to the biggest most prominent things such as war,1,1,positive,
this film is a disaster from beginning to end 75 percent of the movie is made from scenes taken from hercules the haunted world and hercules the captive women badly edited together with original scenes that do not add up to anything but a complete ripoff im a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them reedited and redubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head spin these kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by duping unsuspecting audiences basically killed the sword sandal genre back in the 1960sthere is one memorable scene in the new footage and its the one when hercules fights with the bad hercules the fight is albeit cool and giovanni cianfriglia who plays antaius definitely stands out he makes a memorable nemesis to herc but the rest is borderline embarrassing that was probably shot in a dayavoid at all cost,0,0,negative,

i can find no redeeming value to this movie it appears to be loosely based on the lion king school of thought father gets killed son cant fill the shoes and tries to run away etc etc etc the only difference other than being in a barnyard instead of a jungle is that barnyard tries to liven things up with clubtype music they go way over the top in trying to be cool the problem is that it really isnt cool its like that guy everybody knows at least one of those guys who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to cling onto their youth they try to be cool to fit in but they really arent thats this moviebut hey if you have money to burn and you feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of you life away by all means dont let me stop you,0,-1,neutral,
a number of richard attenboroughs films as director have been biographies of major historical figures young winston gandhi chaplin grey owl is also a filmed biography of a historical individual but in this case attenboroughs subject is a much more obscure charactergrey owl was a canadian writer of the 1920s and 1930s who promoted the ideas of environmentalism and nature conservation at a time when these causes were less fashionable than they are today he was widely believed to be an american indian the story he told about himself was that he had been born in mexico to a scottish father and apache mother and had emigrated to canada where he had been adopted as a member of the ojibway tribe he lived in a cabin by a lake in a remote part of the canadian wilderness where he earned a living as a trapper he toured britain twice in 1935 and 1937 to promote his books and to give lectures on conservationism and achieved great success even being introduced to the royal family during one of these tours attenborough then a teenager saw grey owl at the london palladium theatre after his death in 1938 however it was revealed that he had not been who he claimed to be his real name was archibald belaney and he had been born in the english seaside town of hastingsthe film departs somewhat from the facts of grey owls life in a scene set in 1934 he states that he is 41 years old in reality he was born in 1888 so would have been 46 in that year 46 would have been pierce brosnans age when the film was made so i am not sure why this change was made numerous events are compressed into the last four years of grey owls life 19341938 in the film it is during this period that he meets and marries gertrude bernard whom he called anahareo in reality he met and married gertrude as early as 1925 the film also omits the fact that they were divorced in 1936 and that grey owl remarried shortly before his deaththe revelation of grey owls true identity adversely affected his posthumous reputation and he was dismissed as a fraud his supposed deceit was even used to discredit the causes which he had championed richard attenborough however takes a more sympathetic view of his achievements one of the themes explored by the film is the question of ethnic identity although the erstwhile archibald belaney was not a canadian indian by birth there is no doubt that he had a deep knowledge of ojibway culture and lore and that he spoke their language fluently he was accepted by the ojibway as a member of their tribe it therefore seems unfair to describe his claim to a native north american identity as being a fraudulent one merely because it was an identity he had chosen rather than one he had been born intoaccording to the film grey owls wife gertrude was herself of indian descent but came from a family which had been assimilated into white canadian culture her marriage can therefore be seen as her reclamation of her familys original cultural heritage she was clearly influenced by her husband but she also had an influence on him persuading him to give up his work as a fur trapper as she had moral objections to killing animals for their furone criticism made of the film is that pierce brosnan is miscast as the hero a criticism which seems to be rooted in the preconception that brosnan can only play action heroes in the james bond mould it seems to me however that brosnan may deliberately have taken this role in order to avoid being typecast the taciturn backwoodsman grey owl being about as far from the suave sophisticated agent bond as one can get the original bond sean connery also seems to have deliberately opted for contrasting roles when he appeared in films like the hill or the molly maguires brosnan is in fact very good in this role although i would agree with those who found annie galipeau weak as gertrudeanother frequentlyvoiced criticism with which i would not agree is that the film is boring certainly it is not an action film like the bonds nor is it a great epic biopic like gandhi and it may indeed seem boring to those who were expecting it to be either the one or the other it is however likely to please anyone with an interest in the early days of the conservationist movement or the philosophical implications of national and ethnic identity the scenes of the canadian forests are also beautifully photographed richard attenborough has done us a service by helping to revive interest in this halfforgotten but fascinating figure 710,1,-1,positive,

i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking it sparked my interest but i never expected it to be this great before sunrise is a masterpiece and its also one of the most romantic films on record to my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s its impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andre where there is a conversation but its not just the conversation that matters but let me just say see it see it,1,1,positive,

people tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horrorthriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer whose name escapes me at the moment whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a neverending murder spree its not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on by the way other lowbudget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise like house 3 shocker and ghost in the machine anyway the first power aka pentagram isnt a completely terrible effort but the script overly reverts to clichs and lacks genuine thrills the film starts off as an okay albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cophero lou diamond philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims he receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium played by the gorgeous and underrated tracy griffith she leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe thanks to tess helpful hints detective logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty but patrick channing made a pact with satan himself and returns to the rotten streets of california to do some more killing the first power gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world thats what i would do in his position channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper he annoyingly calls him buddyboy all the time and possesses the bodies of logans friends and colleagues in order to trick him even though never really boring or poorly realized its a very weak film to endure mostly because you constantly get the feeling of djvu writerdirector robert resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful clich the killer got sexually abused as a child and even the players lines can easily be predicted as soon as griffith explains shes able to predict the future you just know that somewhere at some point in the film shes going to say the ridiculously overused line i tell people who to live their lives but my own life is a mess yawn lou diamond philips performance is adequate enough but its rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of la bamba and stand and deliver serious as a tough copper there also are decent supportive roles for mykelti williamson forrest gump carmen argenziano when a stranger calls and bmovie horror legend david gale reanimator appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film,0,0,negative,

john cassavetes 1977 film opening night is what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist overlooked it is an excellent film in its own right and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film its not a perfect film in that at two hours and twenty four minutes its about a half hour too long and theres a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character myrtle gordon played by gena rowlands the wife of cassavetes long after weve gotten the point but only woody allens masterpiece another woman which also starred rowlands eleven years later is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman yet rowlands did win the best actress award at the berlin film festival for this portrayal and it was well deserved often this film written by cassavetes is easily compared to his earlier and inferior film a woman under the influence but its a spurious comparison rowlands character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start as well as coming from a blue collar background while her characters in this film and in allens film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions in this film its the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as myrtles younger doppelganger while in allens film its her characters own past many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic seeing myrtle surround herself with enablers such as a stage manager who tells her during opening night ive seen a lot of drunks in my time but ive never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up youre great but this is wrong for alcohol isnt her problem nor is her chain smoking they are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction and much to cassavetes credit as a storyteller he never lets us find out exactly whats wrong with myrtle and despite her coming through in the end theres no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence this sort of end without resolution links cassavetes directly with the more daring european directors of the recent past who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience and forcing their viewers to cogitate even if it hurtsyet the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama whether or not myrtle gordon does recover after the films universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide and as we have seen before that lid closes ones choices do matter,1,1,positive,

found a copy in a bargain bin sale of this old time classic i played it with dosbox on a vista machine without any issues its graphically dated heavily but what do you expect for a 12 year old game the game is a fpsadventure game hybrid its what i call pseudo 3d you cant look up or down just spin in 360 think wolf3d game play can get tricky with a very limited supply of health pots and a somewhat average interface tip press i but on the whole its passableone main strength of the game is the mood there game heavily uses full motion video and whilst the acting is bgrade and the plot is very choppy the game as a whole feels genuinely creepy it also does a good job of making you question the good guys are they really helping or are they just waiting to stab you in the back the other major selling point is the games length there are from memory 18 chapters which range in game play time from 10minutes to potentially hours my first play through took me a week with some serious devotion of timedated yes but if you missed this years ago and can find it for 5 give it a look cheaper than a movie and more entertaining than most movies,1,-1,neutral,

billy chung siu hungs the bloody swordplay film assassin from 1993 film love to kill hong kong 1993 is among the strongest products of the category iii boom that inhabited the hk cinema in early nineties it consisted of films with strong sex nudity and violence more or less gratuitous and shock valued only love to kill definitely belongs to the more category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sicknessthe hk psycho anthony wong from the award winning the untold story by herman yau from the same year plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture humiliate and rape his young wife elizabeth lee mei fung who for some reason doesnt leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed tormentor a policeman danny lee the famous police character actor from films like dr lamb 1992 by billy tang and codirected by lee and the killer 1989 by john woo to name just a few however sees the problem and starts to protect the wife and the son but anthony naturally doesnt like this at all and leads it all into the typical ultramean spirited and graphic finale during a rain stormthe film is almost completely without any serious merits as its just a piece of exploitation in order to cash in when these kind of films were so popular the imagery and happenings are something never found in the western cinema at least in mainstream and it all becomes even more mindblowing when somemost taboos for westerners like violence and perversions witnessed by a child are broken in these films so often that reading the plotlines alone would make most viewers feel sick and that goes perfectly especially for this film toothe film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned dr lamb which practically started the whole boom in 1992 usually the music and soundtrack in hk films is interesting and adds to the imagery especially in these terror films also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film bathes especially in the finale in blue colors and camera lenses as does assassin too and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera otherwise theres nothing that would rate the film any higher other than on the nastinessmeterthe actors and actresses are talented and professional and so dont make the film any worse with their acting still the film has the usual hk humor in it which makes the sick goingson even sicker as some humor is thrown into the soup that includes some jokes about danny lees erection and so onsomething that could never be found in the western serious films either and that thing usually destroys mane otherwise noteworthy hk films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and massesthe film has a very high outrageousness level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of wongs wife in various ways she gets raped and molested beaten and kicked by her husband we also get to see some flashbacks from wongs own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now these flashback scenes mostly at the end of the film include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up for example the hits of an axe and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene again something that only hk exploitation makers seem to be able to come up with the ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman wields his axe and meets also some nails for example on his furious waythe film is also genuinely pretty suspicious in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should never be taken as entertainment mostly i mean rape the version i saw ive seen two versions includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible im not sure does the hk audience really like imagery like this but i think no one with some sense for morality in filmsentertainment would never accept or make something like it women get brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the fates of the men seem almost tame when compared to the femalesthe other version i saw the newly released dvd in hk without subtitles has this table brutality scene in a much longer form than the subtitled taiwanese dvd which is otherwise identical to the hk version ive also heard that the old hk laserdisc is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film it is impossible to say how uncut versions these that have been released or shown theatrically are obviously plenty of footage has been cut out possibly even before the theatrical releasethe film is written by law gam fai and lau wing kin the former having written also films like dr lamb the untold story and gunmen kirk wong 1988 but out of his other films that ive seen love to kill is the most gratuitous dr lamb and the untold story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one the harrowing torture imagery of the untold story the victim being the criminal is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example but theres none of this in love to kill it is just honest calculated and fastly made exploitation which is by the way produced by a veteran director kirk organized crime triad bureau 1993 crime story 1993 wonglove to kill earns no more than 210 from me as i dont have too high appreciation on films like this hk cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like love to kill are only commercial parasites living among the real pieces of the art,0,-1,positive,
one of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as the murder mystery as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays and since horror films were very popular in those years by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade in which the first movies of the genre were produced aspiring playwright charles belden saw in this renewed interest in murder mysteries a chance to make a name for himself after warner bros picked his threeact play the wax works to create the 1933 horror film mystery of the wax museum belden joined independent filmmaker frank r strayer to keep making films and the ghost walks was one of his bestin the ghost walks john miljan plays prescott ames a young playwright who wants to impress a famous broadway producer named herman wood richard carle with his new play ames takes wood and his assistant homer johnny arthur to his country house for a reading of his play but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm the three men ask for refugee in an old mansion which happens to be property of one of ames old acquaintances inside the house wood and homer witnesses the strange relationship between ames and the house owners however this is all a plan conceived to impress wood everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery unfortunately the murder committed is done for real and while wood and homer think its all fake after discovering ames original plan the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murdereras expected charles beldens screenplay for the ghost walks features the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of its time as we have the stormy night at an old dark house as setting the obligatory group of suspects and the touch of comedy however whats interesting here is how belden makes the film a real spoof on the genre with the many twists he puts in his story to play with the clichs of murder mystery plays the dialogs are excellent full of wit and lighthearted charm and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam by the end it follows the murder mystery routine anyways it never fails to be interesting and entertaining thanks to its smart twists and specially its quirky characters interestingly theres an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical its never denigrating and its genuinely funny at timesby 1934 director frank r strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the poverty row side of the film industry but his partnership with writer charles belden would give him a couple of his most interesting movies and the ghost walks was one of them while obviously done on a shoestring budget and the typical production values of independent films of its time strayer manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric movie that fits nicely the mood and tone of the story the pacing is a little too slow at times but strayer knew that the power of his film was on beldens script and makes the most of it letting his cast to make the most of their characters with excellent results certainly the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal but strayer makes an effective albeit restrained work in this filmas written above the screenplay is filled with great lines that make the quirky characters shine and fortunately most of the cast play with this to their advantage veteran character actor richard carle is remarkably funny as cranky producer herman wood adding a lot of charm to his character specially in his scenes with johnny arthur who plays the flamboyant secretary homer arthur is the one who gets the most best scenes and he gives and hilarious performance as the cowardly yet witty assistant john miljan is just effective as presocott ames nothing amazing but nothing really bad and the same could be said about june collyer as gloria shaw the obligatory love interest whom is just fine however donald kirke is really enjoyable as the malicious terry shaw and its a shame he didnt get more screen timeas usual with frank r strayer films the low budget hurts the film badly as while strayer makes the best he can the film still feels kind of plain at times however the main problem is problem the very slow pace it has as even when the film is filled with sparkly moments of witty dialogs it moves at a pace so slow that can become boring and tedious for moments it also must be said that while effective in their roles miljan and collyer are pretty dull and average when compared to arthur and carle and one wishes the movie had been more focused on the comedic pair they make than on the main couple finally as written above the ending is kind of weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts although credit must go to belden for keeping creative plot twists appearing until the very endone could say that charles belden is an unsung hero of the murder mystery genre as among the many horror and mystery films that came out the b movie studios nicknamed as the poverty row the ghost walks is easily among the best alongisde strayers previous film the vmapire bat despite its shortcomings and even when its definitely not a masterpiece of the genre its a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it pokes fun at its own origin as a murder mystery play a very recommended film if you like the genre

im surprised with the questions and issues this documentary has brought up in the reviews here specially because theyre indeed interesting questions surely the ones who could best address it would be the makers of the film themselves nevertheless i think i can shed some light upon something that i think has been overlooked which is in my opinion the purpose of the film what it is about and what its trying to convey whats its message after all at the risk of pointing out the very obvious ill start saying the filmmakers have an intention theyre trying to tell a story extract meaning out of it and get a point across with this in mind we can shoot down many of the criticized points particularly the ones involving what people expected in contrast with what the filmmakers were really trying to show causes and consequences of violence the film is not about that its not enlightening nonbrazilian audiences about the brazilian favelas issue well who wanted to do that is afroreggae this or that and supported by whom it doesnt matter in this context not enough women in the film for your tastes its not about equality or the feminist cause every little detail about andersons life mother son family and all the aspects and the workings of the afroreggae movement well dont be so picky because it doesnt matter theres just so much length a story can have before it cant become a film anymore if the authors were to show everything everyone is expecting theyd have to make a 6 months tv series instead if you are expecting all that you approach the film the wrong waythe film is actually about two individuals who started a movement two individuals full of ideals two individuals who thirst for change two individuals trying to do something about all the wrongdoing going around them individuals who went rock bottom and wanted to get up again its all about finding purpose in life drawing inspiration from misery changing the destiny and becoming something else than what they were destined to be criminals and drug dealers for that matter its about achievement and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in rio de janeiro though its an integral part of the film given thats what the characters are constantly surrounded by unexpectedly and not without a reason the film ends up centered much more on andersons course through difficulties in life this is because they were faced with andersons accident while they were shooting the film im not sure about this but they may have even seriously considered ending the filming right there leaving behind all effort spent but anderson wanted to keep going and so they did risking to lose in having a film with a bit of an identity crisis considering the sudden change of course but gaining in showing someone overcoming such a devastating happening its very evident for who watches it that the film begins about afroreggae and winds up about anderson its very unique in this sense the shift of the story line maybe their only sin is not making it evident upfront which may initially rise expectations that will go unfulfilledas for the importance or ordinariness of anderson id say not everybody wants to change the whole world end all violence feed all the hungry be like mahatma ghandi be as known as mother teresa or whoever other known personalities there are its much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is such as everybody else in fact trying to transform his or her own harsh life raising problematic kids coping with permanent injuries or diseases and even managing to pay the bills by the end of the month to understand the movie you have to see thats about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime making up for it and trying to persuade others not to go down the same troublesome path though you can criticize if the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method you cannot deny their intentionsalso the perception that anderson is special or a chosen one may have partially something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting as much as becoming friends with them theres no way it wouldnt tint the whole movie with a more favorable light over anderson if a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident its not just a fact you make a big deal out of it and this is not necessarily bad its not much that they treat him like a chosen one as much as they go to great lengths trying to show him as a seed for transformation and source of inspirationin conclusion dont watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime it contains watch it for what it is much more an inspirational storynikeadlike seems just damn good and professionally made to me and doesnt affect or detract from the intentions of the film romanticized speculate on its credential as a documentary if you will but why not when its supposed to cause reaction and inspire isnt trying to better peoples lives through music and dance the essence of what the subjects are trying to do romanticizing the very own reality pardon me but showing just the plain facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on tv every nightif i wanted to become a filmmaker i wish my first film would also be this great,1,-1,positive,

my take even splendid underwater photography can salvage a familiar script and paperthin characters for those who havent already got enough of the free willy pictures flipper might serve up a decent rental others are heavily suggested to stay away although flipper is harmless affair it hardly showcases anything for the adult audience unless its your first time to see a dolphina remake of a 1960s tv show and film flipper may have sound like a good idea back then a dolphin charms the life of boy and a girl they help ave the environment by first getting rid of toxic wastes thrown in on the sparkling waters of the florida keys and at the same time battle a shark and a salty sea baddie who happens to be the one responsible for the toxic dumping and also happens to hate dolphins but even for the 90s especially if an eerily similar film like free willy was a recent hit flipper is just another harmless yet occasionally empty summer splash movie for the kids although the animals this in case is the main dolphin a clumsy pelican and a realisticlooking hammerhead shark typecast as the villain and the pristine underwater cinematography steal the show theres nothing much in flipper to steal from anywaythe story is completely predictable something than nowadays even a 6year old may find evident the human cast led by a prelord of the rings elijah wood and an outofwork paul hogan have rarely anything to do but stand around and look pretty their acting skills whatever they may be to this movie is rarely revealed on screen unless you consider the acting talents of cheerful bottlenose dolphin i guess not trying to recommend flipper as mindless family entertainment wont be fair but anyone over the age of 10 no make that 8 are better off renting or buying something else besides the film is about 95 minutes tops that might just give you enough time to something elsewhere without worrying about your kids that alone might be worth the rentalrating out of 5,0,0,negative,

i watched scarecrows because of the buzz surrounding it well i cant imagine anyone liking this movie because its just bad bad badits obvious that whoever made this movie doesnt know a single thing about horror the whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres action movie guns and criminals and horror living scarecrows when the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows the two genres automatically cancel each other out because first theyre criminals and who cares about criminals and second because theyre stupid criminals to boot having zombie scarecrows go after them just doesnt work here wheres the horror in that i wanted the criminals to die horrible painful deathsbut the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres which could have been original if handle well never gels were simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows which are alive for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible tv like and worse offense of all whole bunches of the dialogue are told on cbs and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if were watching some sort of radio show this part was really bad the director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea i cant tell you how annoying that wasas ive already mentioned the criminals in scarecrows are amazingly stupid for instance when someone suddenly shows up gutted and filled with money and straw yep straw in his huge open wound the others ask what drug is he on after they shoot tons of bullets in him unable to kill him hes been zombiefied by the scarecrows dont ask get a freaking clue morons ive never seen such stupid people in a movie and then theres the girl i wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt when she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow cross she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene bad acting even though the criminals couldnt have done it what a dimwit she was but the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick theyre not scary nothing much is explained about them theyre just a plot device in this plot device filled moviemr wesley filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop doesnt elicit anything but sheer boredom and that scene with the talking head in the fridge thanks for the laughterall in all this had to be one of the worst movies ive seen recently and ive seen a lot of movies these days between the equally woeful silo killer or scarecrows id rather watcher silo killer again yep scarecrows is that bad,0,0,positive,

this is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is what is shown is the incredible poverty in sicily as the 19th century gave way to the 20th a life style that made people dream of the new world of america the mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet just a stone cottage set amid the harsh unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass an opening sequence sees the mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for a sign that they should set out for the new world or remain where they are it further shows life aboard the liner huddled masses indeed yearning to breathe free and conditions in ellis island where their journey still not over they are interrogated and examined to prove their fitness to enter america what is not shown is the ship in longshot or indeed any shot that would identify it as a large oceangoing liner what is also not shown is anything that would identify america no clich view of new york harbour and the statue of liberty so that ellis island could be anywhere in any country perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a camera crane looking down on hundreds of people jammed together slowly almost imperceptibly two thirds of the people at screen left begin to separate from the third at screen right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the dock a powerful statement of society being fragmented theres a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgam of typical familiesconditions at the time with almost nothing happening in dramatic terms its not for the popcorn brigade at the multiplex but for the rest of us its a very fine film indeed,1,-1,neutral,

i just blew four dollars renting this movie why alliance atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me but even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of canadian newspaper critics gave this film im tired of our media justifying a film simply because its canadian and low budget its like they expect canadian films to be lousy so they give it a good review regardlessnow about the movie the acting was below average with the exception of the lead male character who was actually pretty good the film quality was poor which i guess could be expected from the extremely low budget the script was absolutely horrendous an example is the story which revolves around one of the lead characters a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang whose only purpose is to randomly destroy suvs supposedly many of her gang members bicycles are destroyed in these activities i dont know how she cant afford to just buy new ones since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from vancouver to torontoanyway the point of the story which isnt revealed until well over halfway through the movie is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable as no one will want to live in the area need i say moreshame on the toronto film festival for accepting such a film telefilm for supporting it and the globe and mail and georgia straight newspapers for giving such biased reviewsa film shouldnt get special treatment just because its canadian,0,0,negative,

i saw this film at the 2005 palm springs international film festival i went in with the assumption that if it stars chiwetel ejiofor and hilary swank it had to be at least decent well after a kind of a slow start i was far from disappointed in fact i was quite pleased with the final producti must admit the afrikaaner and xhosa accented english of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing waking ned devine trainspotting or any other film with heavyaccented actors i adjusted after about 15 minutes and i was trying to figure out why hilary swank was supposed to be south african and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent but sounded very american as if she was making a weak attempt at putting on the accent but later in the film as more is revealed about her character and how she moved to the us as a teen you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent so it began to make sense that only certain words might have a afrikaaner lilt to themi know its a little weak for one to use film as education but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a truth and reconciliation trial id heard about the t and r process in south africa after the fall of apartheid but i didnt really know how it workedthe final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a little contrived this was overall a very strong film the closing sequence where the truth comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for a definite must see for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders,1,1,positive,

it is said that david lynchs films and shorts wont appeal to everyone neither will dumbland maybe more than ever i have a feeling that dumbland as people come across it will be a true mark of i get it or what the hell its not surrealism exactly but absurd to the point of no return its also very very very stupid but in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it that the maker knows so well how childish and repugnant this is and this selfconsciousness is a plus not a detraction its just a bunch of crudely drawn shorts the kind that might not even make it on hertzfeldt and judges animation show which i might add lynch here has a lot in common with both directors in their work centered on a lummox with an iq of 20 who has a constantly quiveringwithfear wife and a child who looks like a cross between the gingerbread man andor an alien the episodes include little situations like a faulty treadmill a salesman who can recite the gettysburg address watching over a sick brother in law ant hallucinations and just wallowing on the couch with noise all around all the while lynch is still experimenting as he was constantly for better or worse during the period of five years he made on and off inland empirefor one thing hes going back to the roots of his very first short six figures getting sick six times in the usage of repetition as a means to an end this sometimes works excruciatingly well and sometimes not sometimes like with the episode with the sitting around the house doing nothing as teeth are bleeding and a fly buzzes around the absurdism sort of waxes and wanes without much of a good effect and even an episode like with the guys friend coming over is funny moreso for the beavis butthead comparison both laugh like idiots and are equally engrossed by killing things like fish and sheep what ends up working is how lynch shows up front delirious abstractions in the crudest ways imaginable and excessive violence in what comes closest to surrealism in ants the guy mistakenly sprays bugspray just called kill one of lynchs very cheap but fun pokes at societal conventions on himself and envisions ants in a musical chorus line solos included and one of the most harrowingly funny things ive ever seen from the filmmaker is get the stick where we just see the guy cheered on by his son getting a stick lodged in his mouth soon the neck breaks eyes pop out and once said stick is removed he doesnt watch out for traffic waddling like a manhole cover other moments pop up like this in unexpected crevices and its drawn as if on cheap paper with an impetus to shock with foulmouthed language mostly from the man as well as from the grandmother who in one of lynchs voices for the characters is the deepest of all and a shaky quality thats reminiscent of the cream of the crop from early hertzfeldtall the same im still not sure if dumbland is something i would put into someones hands if they havent seen much of lynch yet let alone anything by him there are some little points on society made via complete exaggerations that may or may not be in lynchs mind closer than we usually think to those in real life however in general theres not a whole lot that should be read into it which is why id say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion those who dig the bottomless pits of animated comedy be prepared have a blast,1,-1,negative,
woody allen when at his best has one of the sharpest pens around he can make an acute observation and wrap it around a punch line like nobody else however when hes at his worst his movies can stench of pretentiousness unfortunately melinda and melinda has this stench from opening to closing the set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama to help settle the argument one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing one a comic playwright the other a dramatic playwright whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy the two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave now when i first heard about this film my understanding was that they tell the exact same story the genre comedy or drama only changes by how you look at it now that would have been interesting however the stories only share one main element and a few side elements they are entirely different stories with major plot differences the drama is so stiffly scripted and pretentious that it can only really work as selfparody if this was the point then it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters the comedy is the story that has moments of success but they are still short and fleeting will farrell is obviously meant to be the standin for woody but he could have played this character so much more believably without adding woodys stutters and handticks woody is the best at being woody when someone else tries theyre not playing a character they are modeling a recognizable actor this type of thing only pulls the audience out of the storymy favorite woody allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than i walked in this one made me wish i could get my money back,0,0,positive,

welcome to movie 17 on the chilling classics 50 pack where well see thats right another movie that makes absolutely no sense seriously this movie had me so confused at the end i thought i was rewatching at dawn they sleep the plot seems simple enoughwell that is until 3 seconds into the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and thenum explodes i have no idea what happened and that was before the title screen thats really sad when i cant even tell what happened in the first 3 minutesanyway it stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dumping his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere so we get there but not before somebody steals their jeep to drive it 200 feet out of the way towards a town suspicious nah so they decide to stay at this deserted village with one old lady and then blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking the guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to he gets lost and then finds his way backoh i forgot to mention this is all after an incredibly pointless 20 minutes of them staying in the house of a guy who looks like that buggy eyed guy from casablanca then they leave theres really no point to this scene its really just padding if you cut it out no one would have noticed or caredbut sadly that was actually the best part of the movie wait let me rephrase that really sadly that was the best part of the movie because the rest is so confusing that i had to look on imdb to find out what happened but of course no one else knows so im sol seriously the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most mindscrewing moments ive ever seen on film they dressed her up in a dress he gets kidnapped then released he runs back to the house then at the end the witches are in the house and it ends seriously i have hardly ever been so confused in a movie i mean as bad as movies such as war of the robots are at least they make sense this movie doesnt even make the attempt to be coherent the ending was as confusing as the end of at dawn they sleep and the plot was much more boring this movie gets a 1 just for its sheer i have no idea what happened in this movieness witches mountain gets 1 confused movie watcher out of 10,0,0,positive,
now i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching in the same way that you watch a car crashi appreciate the fact its a spoof but that should not stop me from criticising the godawful directing acting and dialogue seriously this rated as one of the poorest movies i have seen it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper and a poor one at thatokay a few criticisms 1 when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster we never see the monster attack him so we assume its a heart attack the army then launch shells rockets bullets at the monster which was feet from the doctor yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive 2 the army attack from about 100 yards away and we see a flamethrower being used geez those things have a range of no more than 30 metres 3 when the monster tries to take the professor the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling the monster drops the kid and the soldiers dont try to shoot the monster come on 4 the monster looks like it something out of power rangers 5 there is one scene where the five good guys the priest the girl the doctor the reporter and the kid all look shocked and we get reactions along the lines of hand to mouth one after the other so natural 6 the general just runs away time after time 7 the general refuses to try electricity and wouldnt listen 8 the acting is awful 9 did i mention the rubber suit monster 10 that godawful music nonstop,0,0,negative,
refreshing lost gem featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them the douglas and widmark characters are realistic heroes palance is his usual evil presence widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a logical end and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary hollywood you know how it will likely end but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout the end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see the film seems to slow a little past the middle but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion,1,1,positive,

disney has now made straighttovideo sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features two of these were made for their 1991 classic beauty and the beast well these ones arent really sequels as they are both set in between the events of the first film the first of these two straighttovideo films was beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor but i think that can usually be expected with sequels however this second one belles magical world is definitely inferiorthe film features three short stories all of which take place while belle is in the castle and the place is under the spell of the enchantress the first is the perfect word where a misunderstanding at the table between belle and the beast leads to trouble and neither wants to be the first to apologize the next story is fifis folly where fifi and lumieres fifth anniversary is coming up and lumiere is unprepared so belle helps him however fifi sees lumiere practicing romance with belle and thinks theyre actually in love the film ends with the broken wing in this story belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the beast finds out as he hates birds the plot description i gave is for the original vhs version of disneys third beauty and the beast movie apparently in the dvd version there is another story added called mrs pottss party but ive only seen the original version however since i highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest i see no point in watching the special edition anyway the first thing i will say about belles magical world is that the animation is very 2dimensional compared to what were used to from disney which would obviously disappoint many people i didnt like beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas that much but you certainly cant say the same about its animation im sure the stories in belles magical world could entertain many kids mostly younger ones i think and each story has a moral so they could also teach them some valuable lessons however for adults the film really doesnt have a lot i personally didnt find any good humour in it found that the constant conflict between belle and the beast got tiring and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way theyre not very well written in the perfect word the way belle says to the beast youre acting rude and foolish is a bit cheesy and i think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these storiesby the time this straighttovideo movie first came out i was around eleven or twelve years old i dont know what i would have thought of it at the time as i had lost interest in disney by then and it would be years before i would gain any of that interest back even when this movie was first released i think i was a bit past the age group it was aimed at i never saw beauty and the beast the enchanted christmas until a couple months ago but unlike that film i never even heard of this one until recently i think just after seeing the first sequel to disneys 1991 hit well as much as i like the theatrical original i wouldnt have been missing much if i never became aware of this films existence for little kids im sure belles magical world can be highly entertaining and probably somewhat educational with its morals but i do not recommend it for adult disney fans,0,-1,positive,

inside an experimental body suitarmour for some unfathomable reason he is fitted with a rage response activator a device wired into his brain that will turn him homicidal if he comes into physical contact with any other person they give some daft explanation about how it is a necessary defensive mechanism but i cannot see the logic in installing such a device unless you wanted a rampaging cyborg killing machine it is especially ridiculous when it is indicated the suit carl is wearing is actually an experimental space suit what possible need would there be for an astronaut to turn into the incredible hulk whilst on a mission he predictably breaks out of the lab and proceeds to battle the dodgy scientists who put him in the suit along with the ninja assassin hunter played by pam grier no reallythe vindicator itself looks pretty damn goofy it is basically a dude in a mangled golden foil suit he also has a perpetually bewildered look in his eyes that doesnt inspire fear or even compassion i guess you cant blame him for that most people watching the movie will have that same look on their facesthe acting is of the really bad stilted im not sure what the characters emotions or thoughts are that this point so ill take a punt and spurt out my dialogue in a random tone of voice whilst trying not look at the camera school of acting the actor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last partit is after this initial accidental death that the vindicator goes after the scientists strangely enough the whole rage response activator touch me and ill kill you thing doesnt play as big a role as you might expect with carl going after his former colleges in a reasonably detached manner there was one scene where he rather brutally kills some street punks who push him around i know that it is de rigueur for street gangs to randomly assault the lead characters in eighties movies but surely one of them must have realised it might be a bad idea to attack the hulking cyborg guy even if he does look like c3pos retarded cousin as it is they dont even seem that surprised to see a mangled golden cyborg walking down the street as though it was an every day occurrence for them the only other time this rage response activator comes up in the movie is when old carl cant give his wife a hug when hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing her into him so hell be forced to kill her he casually remarks he has reprogrammed himself offscreen naturally so this doesnt happen they could have left out the whole rage response activator thing and just gone with a straight revenge story and it wouldnt have made a huge difference to the moviethere is an amusing sequence in the sewers as grier and her cronies track down the vindicator due to his armoured hide they are all armed with weapons which fire vapourised acid for some bizarre reason when these weapons fire it is represented on screen by cartoonish red lines that streak toward their targets ala ghostbusters the vindicator fights back by ripping a gas pipe out of the wall and incinerating all of griers goons in an enormous streak of flame that comes out the resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the sewers out of a man hole and blows up the van a couple of the scientists are strangely enough grier escapes by throwing herself down into the inch deep water despite the fact she was closest to the vindicator this is one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie including the death of funky black scientist when the vindicator sends his van of a cliff this is after they capture the vindicator by trapping him in a giant lump of gello no seriously there is also one unsettling and long and out of place sequence in which carls treacherous overweight friend who looks like a poor mans ned beatty reveals his infatuation with carls wife and tries to rape her it goes on for about 510 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy slobbering over the wifes face gyrating on top of her and trying to pull her dress off it is icky to say the least and seems really out of whack with most of the rest of the movie which is kind of cartoonish and larger than life in its violencethe movies finale involves the vindicator battling a whole bunch of other dudes in battle suits for whatever reason all these other dudes are less kickarse than carl some of them being dispatched by the wife simply by having a protruding tube in their side ripped out luckily for carl the suit he is wearing lacks this crucial design flaw the only really memorable part toward the end is the death of grier doing something ive never seen a baddie do in a movie before in the middle of her confrontation with the vindicator she decides she really doesnt stand a chance against him and in a rather of matter of fact manner blows her own brains out with his pistol,0,0,negative,
if utterly facile regressive selfindulgent antiestablishment anticivilisation juvenilia appeals to you then this is the ideal film very poorly scripted with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome handheld camera throughout this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic manichean terms all adults especially teachers parents priests and doctors are insensitive and bumbling at best and predatory monsters at worst the only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming yawn and infantile regression literally in a primitive cavelike space in the woods with utopia taking the form of a rave party again in the woods naturally displays all the weaknesses of a first film and plenty more besides,0,0,positive,

easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time i first saw this movie when i was around nine years of age and i have to say that it scared the hell out of me now that im all growed up however i see this movie for what it really is a work of genius everyone or at least everyone with any taste has dreamed of seeing a snowman going around killing people even if they wont admit it i have always found something genuinely frightening about snowmen so naturally for a horror junkie such as myself thismovie was a dream come true some people say that this movie is silly or otherwise void of any intelligence its a movie about a serial killer snowman what the hell did you expect anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid oneliners and cheap gore i love this movie for what it is a comedy and until the movie industry wises up and makes a serious horror flick about a killer snowman which seems impossible unfortunately i will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart,1,1,positive,

after dark my sweet is a great modern noir filled with seedy characters dirt roads and of course sweaty characters it seems that most of the truly great noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south where the men glisten and the ladies um glisten too why because its hooooottttttttttt and because everyone looks better wet at least the men do sweaty women leave me clammy anyway there might be some spoilers in here this film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be steady pacing though some with attention disorders refer to it as slow clearly and broadly drawn though not simple characters and tons of atmosphere noir if anything is about moods and attitudes thats why the great ones are not marked by your traditional definitions of great acting look at bogart mitchum hurt and nicholson they and their characters were anything but real but they had style and sass and in a crime movie thats exactly what you want or quickly paced adventures again all great noirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette great noirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours after dark my sweet lets you do that and it lets you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters uncle bud and collie are intriguing never allowing the audience to know what really makes them tick and patric and dern i love bruce dern by the way are pitch perfect dern especially see previous comment they take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit our sympathies the story itself is also interesting therere better plots in the world of noir hardly any mystery here mostly its suspense but this one is solid if anything the simply okay plot has more to do with jim thompsons writing than anything else with thompson plots are almost secondary he eschewed the labyrinthine tales of hammett and chandler for simpler stories with stronger more confusing characters look at a novel like the killer inside me and and youll see right away from the title what its all about when it comes to thompson its not what its about its how its about it to quote roger ebert so really the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and if you dont like it well the jokes on you why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female lead shes not bad per se but shes not angelica huston or anette benning see the adaptation of jim thompsons the grifters if you dont know what im talking about besides its a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir its the best of the 1990s and challenges blood simple for the title of best since chinatown she simply doesnt have the chops or the looks for that matter and though she and patric have some chemistry i dont have it with her so there,1,1,positive,

this movie was great it was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth the animation was somewhat odd but nothing new from disney it was definitely better than expected for a disney movie with no singingthe background animation was magical it was a different level of work for the disney people some of the characters were a little boxy but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the scenery the music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie this was definitely not a film that needed the characters to bust into songperfect 10 out of 10,1,1,positive,

anyone who visited driveins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films wherever moviegoers ventured aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the 50s came horror movies like voodoo woman and the undead in the 60s were frankie avalonannette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like the glory stompers and into the 70s aip churned out grindhouselevel trash like cannibal girls and sugar hilldillinger released in 1973 is one of the more highbrow aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drivein filmmaking it is one of those uneven overthetop flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned on the whole dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriterdirector john milius magnum force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive careerthe 109minute dillinger epic for aips scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber john dillinger warren oates pretty boy floyd steve kanaly and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson taking along homer van meter harry dean stanton and harry pierpont geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with billie frechette michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 19334 dillinger is basically a chase film with purviss entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hooverdillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around blackandwhite photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace the action scenes are dillingers strongpoint edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american lifethis film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isnt there john milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly bloodfilled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967s bonnie and clyde but we simply dont get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often the film takes on a shootemup persona when its characters could have been explored in detailaside from this the pictures main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that dillinger is just a film its films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as miliuss screenplay and the films documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why milius couldnt have stayed with the facts and written a great story around themwarren oatess performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his largerthanlife image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and its really too bad that miliuss screenplay didnt flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a coldblooded killer other than the stereotype of an easygoing girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly dreyfuss stanton lewis and a brieflyappearing cloris leachman are acceptable for such talentas a piece of 1970s exploitation dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where i picked up mgms dvd release for 499 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drivein flicks with subtitles in french and spanish dillingers theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drivein enthusiasts the film doesnt really call for much

i read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous karate kid installments although my favorite is still karate kid ii i felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share unlike the previous versions the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path rather than a male teenager maggi finds this a little more challenging but rises to the occasion the plot twists are believable and predictable i found that the bad guys are a little one dimensional but this weakness is present in all the installments in varying degrees the camera work is impressive and pans across some beautiful scenery from time to time the zen monastery is both austere and charming the zen monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow i liked the zen bowling scenes which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious zen archery scene earlier on the quality level of the movie is like a good tv series the music chosen for the background is very good especially with the little river band playing listen to your heart the lessons in the movie are valuable and worthwhile to learn they feel faithful to the spirit of karate and take care not to overglorify the fighting part all in all i enjoyed it,1,0,positive,

in 1929 director walt disney and animator ub iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their silly symphonies series the skeleton dance iwerks and disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in disneys laughogram cartoon series however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio that was the birth of celebrity productions where iwerks continued developing his style and technique and where he created the character of flip the frog while his work kept the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed later that year iwerks was hired by columbia pictures and iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in color1937s skeleton frolics is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffins ready for the show thats about to begin as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now its not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance a lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra its hard to dance with loose body parts everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their gravesdirected and animated by ub iwerks himself skeleton frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance years before although with a crucial difference iwerks did the whole film in technicolor the bright tonalities allowed iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before it is certainly a more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesnt mean its necessarily a better film for starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects it looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after allhowever it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film after all iwerks executes it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by joe denat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl w stalling for the skeleton dance in other words while denats tune is effective and appropriate for the theme its easy to forget about it rapidly while stallings song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down iwerks flawless work of animation personally i think that with a better musical accompaniment skeleton frolics would be remembered as fondly as the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking as its still a fun film to watchits kind of sad that most of the work iwerks did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if iwerks lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer disneys main rival he did not lack the quality of those companies films it was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disneys mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite its shortcomings skeleton frolics is a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just cant help but thinking of the skeleton dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that iwerks skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us810,1,0,positive,
this movie probably began with a good idea but thats as far as it went when i read the cover at blockbuster i thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie the movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions there was no explanation of how that would happen but thats okay i thought it would be developed that in the movie it wasnt in the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads beside each one are two attractive women the men begin asking do you hear that or do you see them we conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating the women do not see these creatures this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour it is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called plot of the film we are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be middle eastern terrorists what is this about we never find out the flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why at the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do they blow up the lab but why what is the point we have no idea this film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down the makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline sorry but this movie was a waste of 4 and the time i spent driving to the rental store and then watching it take my advice dont rent it,0,-1,neutral,
those french and those germans sure have a long history of not liking each other it is interesting to note that kamerdaschaft or comradeship in translation takes place in 1931 only a few years later hitler would siege germany and begin his plans to take over the world france being a casualty of his ambitions but these are times of sereneness compared to the future a group of miners at the border try to cross over to france to get work they are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their french neighbors then a disaster happens in the mines of the french and a wellcrafted and written scene a troupe of german miners decide to come to the rescue a simple story is it not pabst was a poet of silent cinema and i am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not but his poetry is there to be discovered he isnt fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal ther is even a flashback to a wwii event that beckons the point of this story supposedly based on a real event the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness smetimes thats what a movie needs to be,1,-1,neutral,

the elegant universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence after watching this documentary one cant help but take a step back and rethink their view on the existence of everything there is a large cast of scientists mathematicians and others on both sides of string theory it is continually brought into question as untested untestable and possibly dead wrong the closest to proselytizing that anyone does is to explain that quantum physics the set of mathematical ideas that give extremely good approximations of what happens to subatomic particles has never made an incorrect prediction not so with string theory no one is willing to say oncamera that string theory is the truth and in so doing the piece retains a certain respectful distance from the subject,1,-1,neutral,

the copy of this movie that i have seen is not very good its grainy and has almost no color in some parts it switches back and forth between english and french often in mid sentence and sometimes even in the middle of a word to make matters much worse there are no english subtitles during the french language parts which i think make up at least one quarter of the film but amazingly the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable even in this condition and i think that says a lot about how wellmade this film isthis is a top notch spaghetti western with great acting an interesting storyline and an excellent music score it also has a cool protagonist a beautiful darkhaired girl some strange characters and events and an overall feeling of melancholy this film has euro written all over iti hope there is a pristine negative or print of this film out there somewhere because it deserves a quality dvd release and when it comes out i will be one of the first in line to get it,1,1,positive,

the film starts with promise because there is more interaction between spanky and buckwheat but as the film progresses the two boys have fewer scenes together this slows the pace considerably billie buckwheat thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes when he is left behind on the riverboat his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking when he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not watching a childrens birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment as another reviewer mentioned i was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones once spanky and buckwheat are in marshall valiants home spanky tends to interact mainly with the adults and the chemistry of the children is essentially lost the old southhuck finntype setting really doesnt do much for the plot except allow the children to be out of doors a great deal ralph morgan is the most engaging adult but then the other roles really dont have much substance to them louise beavers manages some funny moments with a yankee soldier towards the end the villains arent really villainous enough and the lovers not intense enough yet i do think its worth viewing if youre an our gang enthusiast if for no other reason that the odd curiosity of the whole piece i give it seven stars because while not a great movie it kept me engaged the whole time and curious as to what would happen next,1,1,positive,

whoever said that horror wasnt an educational film genre huh thanks to this marvelous hammer short movie i now at least know never to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house because he might just be hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts mind forever thank you hammer the tenth episode in the house of horror series is another one ive been looking forward to seeing mainly because the guy in the directors chair was don sharp one of britains finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated sharp was responsible for some very cool hammer films like kiss of the vampire and rasputin the mad monk as well as some overlooked independent productions like dark places and psychomania his contribution to house of horror is easily one of the best in the series with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes the plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror but its actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon choronzhon the demonic guardian of the abyss the mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies but michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device when he picks up a clearly petrified girl whos running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical british horror topics but david fischers screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits among which a highly inventive climax theres also plenty of tension to admire the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid especially john carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie recommended,1,-1,positive,
a strong woman oriented subject after long director krishna vamsis shakti the power the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevis first homeproduction a story about a womans fight against harsh injusticethe story of the film revolves around nandini karisma kapoor who lives in canada with her two uncles tiku talsania jaspal bhatti there she meets shekhar sanjay kapoor falls in love with him and they soon marry their family is complete when nandini has a boy raja master jai gidwani but their happiness is short lived as the news of shekhars ailing mother deepti navalmakes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india and thats when the problems start from the moment they reachindia both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere they take a crowded train to reach shekhars village and when they finally reach the station they have to catch a long bus drive to his village the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a neverending drive and unfortunately for them a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus fortunately they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him after that they drive to the handing havel where shekhars father narsimha nana patekar lives with his wife deepti naval nandani realized that her fatherinlaw is in command as soon as she enters the place but her only solace is her motherinlaws warm welcomeliving there nandini learns of her fatherinlaws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him the day she sees her fatherinlaw teach her son to throw a bomb she loses it and lashes out against him insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel fatherinlaw her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heartwrenching filmwhat sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie the only drawback is ismail darbars music which fails to rise above the script the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena which has been composed by anu malik another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and hes shown his versatility once again with this role sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors deepti naval too is in top form and her prclimax showdown with nana is praiseworthy shahrukhs cameo provides the lighter moments and surely hes been pulled in to get the required star value though his role was not really required hes done it well overall shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the prrelease hype is sure to get it a good opening shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch,1,0,positive,
nice attempt and good ideas redemption of the prostitute human beings helping each other out but a poor result the director obviously tried to emulate his french colleague tran anh hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray viet nam the only problem is that this viet nam is long gone and when the scent of the green papaya had a historical background trying to project this kind of ambiance muffled sounds and the slow pace of life on modern days leaves a feeling of fake besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obviousi can only suppose the action takes place in saigon or da nang because that is where harvey keitel exmarine in the movie was probably stationed during the war but in southern viet nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip northern accent displayed by the actors seriously odd even for a bad vietnamese speakeran old poet with leprosyvery doubtful not a disease for people of his condition a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate vietnamese poetry even more doubtful,0,0,negative,
my friend and i picked paperhouse out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the horror section neither of us had heard of it but the blurb on the box was really promising and the movie didnt disappoint though i still probably wouldnt call it a horror movie exclusively11year old anna madden draws a house and visits it in her dreams she is definitely asleep when shes seeing the house but its so real in a sense that its almost like a completely separate reality which in view of later events doesnt seem like a far cry from the truth anyhow she finds she can add to the house its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture while this is going on anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing on top of that she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father he has a job that takes him away for long stretches though one gets the impression theres actually more to the story than thatok so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough but frankly theres something really menacing about it the dreamworld is eerily surreal the house for instance is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field the folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate worldongoing dreamone of the things anna adds to the house is a boy mark who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about im not giving that away you know from the moment he appears that its the same kid in reality mark cant walk due to an illness in annas drawingworld he cant walk because she didnt draw him any legs she blames herself for his reallife illness and tries to rectify the situation but everything starts getting really weird she even brings her absent father into the drawing with disastrous results the bits with the father are really terrifyingi dont want to give anything away so ill stop there there seems to be a lot going on in this film im sure youll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it is it a simple a story as it seems or are there actually layers of meaning i dont know but either way its quite fascinating there was a nightmare on elm streetish quality about it in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect i love things like thatmy only complaint is that it feels like it could have ended many times but didnt im satisfied with the ending it had some of you sensitive types might want to have kleenex handy though it really could have a variety of conclusions anyway it doesnt exactly feel drawn out once its actually over but while youre watching and it keeps fading back in its a little nerve wrackingstill paperhouse is a really good film its well done and acting especially charlotte burke as anna is top notch burke who has never before or since appeared in a film is a real gem i dont know why she never went onto do anything else but either way shes really convincing and enjoyable to watchpaperhouse isnt exactly a horror movie its sort of a fantasysuspensesomething else type of movie with some definite horroresque moments but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or somethinggive it a chance you wont regret it and maybe you should read the book too,1,1,positive,

this is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent lowbudget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost 100 accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer 2001 was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that 17 people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you dont see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesnt look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmers death in 1994 due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior thats about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as ive stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of americas most remembered serial killers i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer,1,1,positive,

i think i agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average dark remains is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you the movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely interwebbed which even later are not tied together a couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed they move to a country house to flee their past and guess what the house is haunted kind of from here on dark remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed the first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good ok then woman sees ghost of daughter other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear man tries to solve secret of houses past woman gets depressed strange neighbors appear its pretty much all been there but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice so you wait for the twist there is no twist you are just confused by a haunted house history story the strange neighbor a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photoidea reminding me a lot of the shutter the end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some hoards of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music to make it short dark remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowheretoo many stories mushed together which just dont make any sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie and beside please never use abandoned prisons again its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all hey there is this creepy prison uphill lets shoot there i guess a lot of ingredients in dark remains were thrown in the mix like this,0,0,negative,
even though this movie starts off with the usual something goes wrong spacecraft crashes people are stranded etc it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas riddick is somewhat of a badass convict and has modified his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the shipcrew and he gets in the cutting in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique that shrouds around the antihero and male protagonist riddick the story in pitch black is as already mentioned to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied but the clipping and cutting in the movie blended with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more vin diesel acts really well in the role as riddick and even though his character is a hardcore tough survivor he still takes morale decisions almost on the verge of good but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end why destroy an already perfect reputation all in all this is a very good movie though not perfect the story seems very unoriginal at the surface but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average it could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a spiced up scifi story blended with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist namely riddick,1,0,positive,

a special day ettore scola italycanada 1977every once in a while you come across a film that really touches a nerve this one offers a very simple premise almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time its surprising ettore scolas una giornate particulare is relatively unheralded even hated by some critics time out calls it rubbish and leonard maltin somewhat milder pleasant but trifling i disagree not only because this film is deeply moving but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist italy than most films ive seen the cinematography is distinctly unflashy even a bit bland and the storyline straightforward which might explain the films relative unpopularity considering late 70s audiences werent exactly spoiled with great italian films its even stranger this one didnt really catch on with the criticsthe film begins with a tenminute collage of archive footage from hitlers visit to italy on may 8th 1938 set against this background we first meet antonietta loren a lonely loveridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building one day when her beo escapes she meets her neighbour gabriele mastroianni who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies he is wellmannered cultured and soon she is attracted to him during the whole film we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings after the opening scene the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist hypermodern at the time apartment block seemingly searching for our main characters whom we havent met yet marcello mastrionani and sophia loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type canadian born john vernon plays lorens husband but he is only on screen in the first and last scene i figure his voice must have been dubbed since hes not of italian descent and never lived there to my knowledge so i cannot imagine he speaks italian if his voice has been dubbed i didnt notice at all on the contrary hes completely believable as an italian even more than the rest of the cast the story is simple but extremely effective the performances are outstanding the ending is just perfect and the framing doesnt come off as overly pretentious but works completely dont miss out on this onecamera obscura 910,1,1,positive,

while not truly terrible this movie is still largely a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of beach boys historybasically this movie would have you believe that mike love was the brains behind the band and brian wilson was just a pathetic psycho in fact none of the characters is developed beyond a onedimensional parody but this is a tv movie so what do you expect mike loves foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to rewrite history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius yeah as ifon the plus side the music is excellent unlike the previous beach boys madefortv biopic summer dreams this movie actually features real beach boys music rather than anemic cover versionsalso it features a surprising number of beach boysrelated rarities and seldomheard tracks the sunrays i live for the sun being but one examplethis movie was originally shown in two parts on american network tv part one is the superior of the two and documents the boys early days and rise to the top by the time part two rolls around the brian wilson character has become a mere cartoon and the actor seems to be playing for laughs but how could anyone take this crap seriously if youre not a beach boys fan you probably wont get much out of this movie except an extremely warped and onesided view of the bands history but then again why would you watch this if you werent a fan,0,-1,positive,
as the number of video nasties ive yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage popped up on my to rent list when i saw it was availablethe premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip though if he returns with the girl and all the money he gets a significant cut hes brought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot is one of the worst actors ever granted they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood after stealing away into the jungle we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour now this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever pingpong balls for eyes and thats pretty much it his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and i found myself muting much of those scenesoh did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity this is probably the main reason this film was banned though there is one specific scene about one second long where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out but its not a redeeming factor for gore fans also jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy closeups of female genitals and sadly male as well so if you want fair in terms of exploitation you got iti cant recommend this trash to anyone its not even the good bad movie its just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then if you are making your way through the list leave this for the very last if you watch it first you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list which is certainly not true,0,0,negative,
i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by maneating ants what i didnt remember was how awful it wasi recently caught this movie on television late at night im sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again suzanne somers at the pinnacle of her career playing chrissy on threes company plays a vacationer at lakewood manor constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants nest or should i say a maneating ants nest one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants one minute hes picking them off his clothes one by one the next minute hes covered in them the next scene shows a skeleton in the dirtif you thought that was pretty farfetched you should see myrna loy playing a wheelchair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the manor via helicopter i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the moviethe final scenes depict suzanne robert foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other blowing through straws and covered in antsthats basically the movie theres really no disaster appeal or bigstar draw to the film it was intended to be a grandscale television event at the time now its lucky if it gets dumped in a 400am timeslot on your local television stationif you want to catch suzanne somers at her best then watch an episode of threes company if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills then watch this movie010,0,0,positive,

this movie is best described or compare to big fish the movie by tim burton but its a less glamorous and more in you face tale and of course here its not the father but his grandfather who tells the storiesthe movies narrative also moves back and forth so the story outline here at imdb might tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie its funny and engaging enough even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too it also surprises you here and there with things you wouldnt expect a nice little movie then that deserves your attention especially if you like movies like that o,1,-1,positive,
i saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though i knew it wasnt of award winning caliberi kinda liked it it tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids which is to climb mt whitehead of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways but none too differently than they were as children richard lewis is still neurotic richard belzer is still a playboy franklyn ajaye is still sort of the dear abby of the group and tim thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group of course the top billed star is louie anderson a true believer in everything cub scout related he still lives in the same house with his mother still goes over the cub scout manual daily is brave reverent and clean and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in scouting compounding their task however is the grunski brothers two bullies drummed out of the cub scouts by the above mentioned by coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit albeit harmlessly not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts who think pack 7 is from the fbi and are intent on wiping them out all in all the movie still has bits of charm observe richard lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot for example and you have a really funny bit going for you upon further review the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor it doesnt hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure,0,-1,neutral,
i wasted 575 to see this crappy movie so i just want to know a few thingswhat was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie the disease had nothing to do with being split in halfwhat was the point of dragging karen into the shed she already totally infected her room they could have just locked her in there where she would have been saferwhy would the hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative the hog lady to take him to the hospitalwhy didnt any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad are they all really that lazyeven if paul was threatened by the guy w the shotgun for peeping on his wife paul could have just sent jeff or bert back to the house to ask for help the girl he loves is deterioratingwhat was the point of the boxwhy did jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldnt he have just gone back homeif the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit why did they throw paul halfway into the river it wasnt even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminatedwho makes lemonade out of river water that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it why couldnt the two kids have just use the tap water it was contaminated too so the stupid ending would still work,0,0,positive,
five teens set out to do some camping in the oregon wilderness and despite being warned by the park ranger they soon realize that something is lurking around in the backwoods waiting to strikewhen it comes to old horror movies the only one that keeps popping up in every conversation is friday the 13th so i took it upon myself to find those good old horror movies that fell short for simply being compared to friday the 13th just before dawn just so happened to be among the ones i found and was really very impressive it wasnt as bland as some of the stuff you find today it was very sharp in terms of character development as it had quite a few likable ones and it has this very casual pace its not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits it takes its time to set the proper mood and tone and is very atmospheric and builds some killer suspense by letting you always have that sense of dread like somethings out there but you dont know where it is or when it will strikewhere i live its definitely an overlooked gem simply because people never heard of it or wont give it a chance but ill state that it is not a friday the 13th rip off the two concepts dont even go near each other but in my mind it is overall one of the more impressive slashers ive seen in a while,1,-1,neutral,

i saw this movie at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by hbo to be shown on their cable network sometime this year this movie presents page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and bd stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the 50s pinup icon this film is supposedly based on the book the real bettie page by richard foster its shot in black and white for that 1950s nostalgia feel i have the book called bettie page the life of a pinup legend that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of page and i must say that this movie reproduces on film with gretchen mol as page many of those famous photos very accurately mol herself with the bettie page black wig and brown contact lenses is bettie page not only does she have the bettie page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect and her body is as close to a replica of pages as possible terrific casting the story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better but this is a pretty good tv movie i would rate it a 70 of a scale of 10 and recommend its viewing when it comes on tv,1,1,positive,

in a way this is the disaster fellini has been working towards all his life the line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings that said casanova left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by bukowski casanova died too just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all to say that he lived well is true to say i could spit on his grave without feeling is also true the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find that is why the human race stands where it does today we have bred the clever and lasting casanovas all hollow inside like the easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children as far as i could make it out this is the position fellini takes regarding his subject granted with more empathy but disgusted nonethelesscasanovas environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior themes fellini dealt with more pointedly in satyricon the succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn just without the coherence and donald sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distractionyet there might just be a point in portraying casanova as an unsightly fool and i challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious fellini couldnt more than ever he seems here like a dirty old man a maestro for sure but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else i find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film it was a story not worth telling,0,0,negative,

its important to keep in mind the real meaning of the phrase inspired by a true story when watching pride its sort of like you could save up to 50 which can quite literally be translated to you cant save more than 50 it all sounds great until you realize that the lower part of up to is zero similarly inspired by a true story means that someone heard a story and it made them think of this one the only certainty is that the real story and the one youre about to see are not the same thingthere is a real jim ellis that began coaching the swim team at the philadelphia department of recreation in the early 1970s but i have a feeling that the real jim ellis must not have been able to conceal some feelings of disappointment at the way the movie turned out clearly it takes wild liberties with the story of his life and i just picture him responding to the strange looks of his friends who wonder why the movie is so much different than the man they knowat any rate one thing that he will surely be proud of is that he is portrayed by terrence howard one of our finest actors who starred alongside bernie mac who despite the lack of an original and powerful story still gives a heartfelt and moving performance the movie takes place in 1970s philadelphia a time and place where racism was the norm not the exception and the educated and professional jim ellis who is also an accomplished swimmer is having trouble finding a worthwhile teaching position until finally relegated to a falling apart recreation center which he is assigned the task of cleaning up before its demolition we can certainly understand his feeling of belittlement when we first meet elston the maintenance man bernie mac he is a disillusioned grump who sits in his office surrounded by piles of junk that touch the ceiling and watching daytime tv on an old dusty television set needless to say when jim shows up to start cleaning the place up and clearing it out elston is not exactly friendly with him he knew his rec center was being closed and all his anger about that transferred quite smoothly onto jim given his past as a college swimmer jim takes a special interest in the pool which he cleans and fills and brings to top shape a group of black teenagers who play basketball just outside the rec center take interest in the pool when their basketball rim is taken away and the heat remains stifling and soon the group have a developing swim team on their hands which they enter into a citywide swim meet to call them underdogs of course would be something of an understatement theyre unorganized unprofessional insufficiently trained and have no idea how to behave at a swim meet that doesnt matter of course the movie is your standard underdog sports story so the first athletic outing is totally unimportant as anything other than a learning experience a catalyst to drive their much harder and much more focused training that will lead up to the final athletic outing the one that matters by now the only thing a sports movie has going for it is that the protagonists do not have to win at the films climax we only have to understand the meaning and significance of their effort sadly the movie has all of the character development of an old seagal movie the good guys are the good guys because theyre just supposed to be and the bad guys are the nasty white swimmers who laugh and jeer and make racist jokes at our team oh and theres one scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys underwater while in the middle of a race i didnt know it was really possible to kick someone underwater like that but you get the idea of how deep the character development iswe understand that this is the group of kids that jim ellis turned from kids hanging out on the streets doing nothing with their lives and into an organized and competitive team of swimmers but other than that we dont really get to know anything about who they arebut the biggest problem is that the only real statements that the movie makes are that effort and organization lead to success and racism is bad both of these are so obvious that when a movie is made with them alone it ends up feeling empty and unnecessary racism was so much more powerful in america in the 1970s that it feels like an enormous loss that the movie dealt directly with that issue but didnt really say anything about it its sort of a feel good movie but when its over and you realize how much it should have said is much bigger than what it said the feelgood sensation turns into a sad disappointment,0,-1,positive,

before seeing this i was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated emmanuelle series starring sylvia kristel it was really surprising how good this one turned out to be it actually has a story and it is very romantic indeed what makes yellow emanuelle so good is its leading heroine the beautiful and exotic chai lee she plays her character emy wong so sweetly that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her emy wong is a muchrespected doctor statuesque with a regal quality she comes from an important old family where ancient customs are still practiced emy will remain a virgin until she is married to a man she has never met the beautiful doctor seems ok with this arranged marriage it is simply how it is done in her world however she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the british pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works emy decides to do away with custom and she gives herself to her western man but only after a very long courtship as doctor wong is anything but an easy woman her pilot george is a good guy and promises to marry emy so that she doesnt lose her respectability and place in her rigid society neither one counts on a third party one ilona staller who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her her place in society is gone she has been debased the film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud elegant woman gives up her career as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution i was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale i was on the edge of my seat when george blows back into town and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful emy is working as a prostitute classic drama i imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama one would expect lots of sex and nudity here but there is not much and when there is it is totally nonexploitative and very artsy and softcore if you are a fan of the first emmanuelle with sylvia kristel than you most likely will appreciate this lesser known classic i was especially impressed by the extra attention to details the whole segment where emy takes george to her fathers house on the island is really nice her father shows george and the viewer his impressive collection of bonzai trees he has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees totally unexpected after catching it on late night cable tv years ago i spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film when i finally got it i found that the video version was longer more sex no more melodrama for the dvd release there is a subplot about george suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease i actually preferred the cable version better i am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on dvd i must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70s soundtrack while watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare and quite special i recommend it to thoughtful viewers who dont need sex and violence to maintain their interest,1,1,positive,

biodoc on the enigmatic singersongwriter who according to friends accounts spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life seemingly on a mission of selfdestruction he died at 52 overweight and dissipated of heart disease after a protracted rampage of virtually nonstop overindulgence in alcohol cigarettes marijuana and cocaine raucous partying and flagrant misuse of his vocal instrument he confided to a friend that he shouted out his lyrics at one performance with such force that spattered blood was left on the microphoneall of this despite the fact that he was 1 widely considered to have perhaps the most gifted pop singing ability of his generation 2 successful after years of effort in terms of industry acclaim a grammy an oscar a decent recording contract with a top label and at least two stellar albums nilsson schmilsson originals and a little touch of schmilsson in the night standards and 3 very happily married for the third time with a lovely young family that he seemed to adorethe films strengths begin with the completeness of its account of nilssons life including fine use of archival film footage and many stills of nilsson the editors do an especially good job of bringing movement to the stills we learn of his close ties to john lennon and later ringo starr lennon often said that nilsson was his favorite american musicianeven more impressive are the talking heads often a documentarys weakest aspect here we get people like perry botkin jr ray cooper mickey dolenz terry gilliam mark hudson eric idle rick jarrard randy newman van dyke parks jimmy webb and robin williams all telling amazing stories about nilsson many uproariously funny others deeply pathetic and everyone conveying their deep affection for him equally informative and moving are interview segments with nilssons wives annie and una his son zach and cousin doug hoefer best set of heads i can recall in a biodocthe most glaring deficiency of the film is that it crowds out nilssons music even the performance of his greatest hit without you is cut short after about 8 bars arrrrgh there is no excuse for this not given that the movie runs a full two hours as it is lose a few head shots and we could have heard at least that song through and perhaps one or two more like one or his oscar winning cover of everybodys talking the filmmakers are simply too intent on plumbing nilssons psychological mystique and not attentive enough to his music my grades 7510 low b seen at the nwfcs reel music series 010707,1,1,positive,

you know im sure the boys were sitting around the office one day and said how can we make more money they had made every possible variant of toy they could make with their current characters so they decide lets steal the star wars idea a prequel and we can make up all new characters and sell them as toys incidently something they did in puppet master 3 but who cares anyway they pick a point in time before the first movie when toulon is still alive he and the puppets are sitting around and a wooden head roll on the floor and the puppets want to know if that is a dead family member or something it doesnt matter so the tale of the puppet master ancestry begins its long its boring no body caresthe funniest part is they tell the origin of these new characters in the movie but give no clues of their fate so guess what once the revenue from the new toys pays off they can fundsa new and 4th straight rotten sequel called puppet master 8 the sequel to the prequel of the fate of the dead retro puppets hold your breath,0,0,negative,

meltdown opens on a scene of scientists preparing to conduct an important test on a missile system developed to deflect asteroids should they be on a collision course with earth nathan vincent gale mentions some misgivings to his but the test appears to be an unqualified success then the asteroid breaks apart and the largest piece is pushed into a direct collision path with earth fortunately the huge rock skips off of earths outer atmosphere and ricochets into space unfortunately the glancing blow is just enough to alter earths orbit and the planet begins to spiral closer to the sunwhile all of this is going on above their heads los angeles cops tom casper van dien and mick greg anderson are on a stakeout theyre supposed to collect evidence against a suspected drug dealer but the deal theyre watching quickly devolves into a shooting match afterward tom takes a few minutes to be interviewed by a local television reporter who also happens to be his girlfriend carly stefanie von pfettenat a nearby hospital where mick is treated for a minor injury tom has a brief chat with his exgirlfriend bonnie venus terzo who is a nurse he tells her hes concerned about the fact that their 17 yearold daughter kimberly amanda crew is dating a man named cj ryan mcdonell once tom explains to bonnie that hes discovered cj has a criminal record shes a little worried herselfits not long however before everybody has something else to worry about the temperature is rapidly rising all around the world carly is one of the first nonscientists to learn whats really happening nathan who is her brother calls her to say he may have a way that they can survive carly calls tom he of course promptly contacts bonniein relatively short order the motley group is on the road before they can reach their ultimate goal however theyve got to make their way through bands of looters deal with a catastrophic water shortage and manage to travel in temperatures that are high enough to killcasper van dien is a good looking guy and i actually enjoyed him in starship troopers that may be because hes good in action scenes it might also be because he didnt talk much in that movie in meltdown hes unfortunately given just enough lines in situations that are just dramatic enough to showcase his entirely average acting abilities amanda crew is also okay and ryan mcdonell isnt bad either vincent gale and stefanie von pfetten are also both reasonably good but venus terzo is sadly on a par with van dienwhat really makes or breaks a movie though is the story and the script while the story here is okay and actually has some real potential the script is just awful the science part of the science fiction is nonexistent starting with the asteroid pushing the earth out of orbit and escalating with the notion that the gravitational balance of the solar system might pull the earth back into its usual orbit over time when the temperature in la hits 120 degrees cars start blowing upyou know whats even worse than the bad science the bad continuity okay really hot why are people in the movie not only wearing long sleeved shirts but jackets too why are people mugging each other for bottled water instead of turning on the taps at home why are the streets completely empty but the freeways completely full and why are the freeways full of unexploded its almost superfluous to note that the sets costumes and production values were good especially when that only forces me to say that the edits were notso basically you take a pretty good story idea and combine it with mostly mediocre acting a terrible script lowend special effects utterly irrational plot twists and poor edits and what do you have a movie thats even less than the sum of its inconsiderable parts im sorry to say that i cant recommend meltdown days of destruction to anyonepolitical notes there is mention here that congress finally loosened the purse strings enough to fund the tests that start the movie rolling while the tests here were wholly irresponsible targeting an asteroid with a nuke and not knowing the composition of the big rock is in fact well beyond irresponsible and approaching the insane the fact is that such scenarios are a very real danger to the planet unfortunately weve tracked nowhere near all of the near earth asteroids that could be worrisome in some orbit some day and our ability to spot something on a collision course with us is limited at bestonce we do discover were going to be hit we quite literally have no system in place to deal with it there are no nucleartipped space missiles we can launch the space shuttle is completely incapable of going beyond earth orbit and if it were we couldnt launch enough of them or launch them quickly enough for it to matter im not big on the government doing anything beyond its constitutional mandates but i certainly think protecting the planet from destruction coming at us from outer space could be construed as defending the country dont you family suitability meltdown days of destruction is rated r for some violence i frankly didnt find the violence here anything beyond a fairly typical trated video game if your teens

trite and unoriginal its like someone watched immortal beloved and amadeus and decided to mix them together and in the process steal other formulaic plot parts from other movies to make another one as with most historical movies nowadays there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better suit the story which is understandable for the most part for example during the remaining days of beethovens life it was necessary for other people to write down what they needed to say in order for him to understand them that of course would have been a nuisance to have to show on screen the script although filled with some quotable lines doesnt quite capture the feel of that time period and coupled with some bad acting seems rather contemporary diane kruger is nice enough to look at but she still has lots to improve on her craft ed harris doesnt work for me as beethoven and i mostly blame gary oldman for that overall not a very good interpretation of the musical maestros life better just find yourself a copy of immortal belovedhttpiwascalledclementinemultiplycomreviews,0,0,positive,

at last ive finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now ive only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the 90s with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possiblethis was the lovely meena kumaris film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from 1958 on finally realising it in 1971 what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her facethe story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but im led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india its a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to me its the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding ive seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet with lata because of all this but not blind to its faults pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra,1,-1,positive,

i cant quite explain why i find this so alluring and the leopard not it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film those intimate moments that visconti can render so magnificently like that film it has a majestically slow pace but this time it isnt overlong its the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that i think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own ministory like the leopard it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos though bogards performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable especially in look he has a really stupid grin thats easy to dislike its often quite beautiful in the quiet moments its the opulence of viscontis films the grandeur of the ball scenes that i find tedious as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision but here that is part of the point gustav surrounded by a visual dinthe way in which the object of gustavs affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant the camera shows a girl girl girl then this beautiful femininefeatured boy its like an allusion to shakespeares sonnets and it doesnt feel heavyhanded its not until the camera views tadzio fully pulls back and we see his long slender legs that we realize he is not a boy but an adolescent at first were forced to question gustavs attraction in an uncomfortable way visconti must have known that and he doesnt shy away from it visconti is extremely patient with gustav we get a sense of the man we know him its a largely silent performance and when he does open his mouth its to spew venom no wonder he wants the angelic openfeatured boy to project himself onto theres a difference with tadzio we never know him just as we never know a handful of fellini grotesques but thats because his life is another its own film but its not as flirtatious as its been made to seem there is one scene however where he twirls around a pole thats too much tadzio isnt necessarily leading him on hes looking at him visconti just zooms in is allthe film doesnt detail gustav as being gay tadzio isnt even really male hes a prettified version of a boy delicate pale wispy with golden locks that everyone seems to love including one gorgeous slightly older young man who he wrestles with the closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to gustavs homosexuality is the famous barber scene which unlocks his repressed vanityit isnt totally successful the whole section with alfred is a waste and some unnecessary scenes people carrying bags in long shot could have been excised some parts are heavyhanded such as when gustavs boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by the looks on his face are too obvious but during the same scene gustav throws a fit wanting a new rower something so unexplainable that it makes up for it but there are some scenes touching for the first time that build up a remarkable quiet intensity tadzio repeating a piano song again and again the notes quivering in the air may be the best example of the anxiety the film has there is one discussion that contains a debate im especially interested can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses or does it have to go beyond them we can consider tarkovsky who esteems both visconti and mann to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations i think this one manages to do both 910,1,1,positive,
jarl and moodysson are part of an dying breed of political film makers the swedish population should appreciate that they try to uncover the truth when the government and media actively distorts and cover up the events surrounding the eu meeting in gothenburg it is absolutely heartbreaking to see how these innocent kids have been abused and drugged by the swedish police and convicted to prison in political trials for sending text messages and as revenge for others actions the only unfortunate thing about this movie is that it will not reach the broad masses in sweden as it will only be shown it theaters and not be released on video or aired on televisionthe political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and insight into complex issues and has a role to play as an educator of the masses,1,-1,neutral,

farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama where she plays marjorie a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a wouldbe rapist well done to farrah for being a golden globe best actress nomineewhen her rapist joe terrifically played by james russo comes into her home which she shares with her two roommates who are conveniently out marjorie has to play along with joes frightening demands it does make for some disturbing and shocking imageswhen her roommates come home they are astounded to say the least by marjories actions and a great performance by alfre woodard who desperately tries to convince marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police makes the film even more nailbitingi do find diana scarwid quite irritating but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeedoverall extremities is a brilliantly thoughtout and wellacted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now well done to everybody involved,1,1,positive,
why did i go to see this film honestly because jim carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter so do you really blame me for expecting that again additionally the premise the funny trailer his costar jennifer anistons involvement and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged mehowever as my one line summary suggests i was disappointed for various reasonsreason 1 it wasnt funny in a 2hour movie i laughed for about 510minutesall together the rest of the time i sat thinking i really should have got some icecream i admit that maybe it is wrong to judge jim carrey on his previous films but what does he really expect when he makes gems such as the truman show liar liar me myself and irene dumb and dumber the mask and the ace ventura films then produces in bruce nolans own words such a mediocre filmreason 2 jennifer anistons role was criminally underwritten i mean hello shes been around in the public eye for about ten years now and in this film she gets about four lines to say wrongreason 3 one word clichreason 4 a casual deployment of specifically american references jimmy hoffa walter cronkite sweeps week is a clue to the films specifically homegrown appeal a teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education thats a miracle want to see a miracle soon be the miracle god tells bruce a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the us but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety additionally i still go to school and that statement suggests me and all of my friends are miraclesor maybe it just means we have brainsin this film there are enough funny carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent bruce almighty from being a total calamity but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards,0,-1,neutral,
walking with dinosaurs is absolutely brilliant in every regard kenneth branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen the script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go the music is also brilliant very dramatic when it needs to be but the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well the scenery is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so real thanks to the simply astounding effects this is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids tooin conclusion this is a must watch not only did i love this but this is quite possibly the best documentary i have ever seen if anything it could have done with being longer other than that this is perfect 1010 bethany cox,1,1,positive,

rivers edge is not a pleasant film to watch but it is an incredible one having viewed it many years ago i truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing very well acted and just unpleasant at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools fantastic,1,1,positive,

priyadarshan whenever a person heard his name his first thought would be comedy that is what this man is known for or rather was known for after giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like hungama hera pheri and hunchul his train derailed slowly with movies like chupke chupke and a few others whose names i cant recollect for now now with hideous films like dhol the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be torturedhol is a mixture of bad unfunny toilet jokes somewhat of drama poor suspense and idiocracy the only good thing about dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny though not witty and secondly except for kunal khemu and the hysterical grandma the acting was decent speaking of the acting i felt that rajpal yadav and sharman joshi were at the top if you compare them with the others in the movie then came tusshar kapoor then tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above the flaw in kunal khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting the grandma firstly resembled a ghost plus she was not funny at all but rather sillythe plot was the same seen before one four boys behind girls and in need of money but with a few twists there is a bad man who is preposterously stupid and dumb and at last the good wins over the bad and everything is fine the idea of having a dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not wittythe worst thing about the movie is its length after an hour or so you get exhausted and want to leave the theater but being a critic it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie the movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different placeif your motherinlaw has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything then send her for this movie and have fun 3 out of 10,0,0,negative,
i havent seen this movie in a while so im afraid i cant be very specific about details it did have some interesting points ralph bakshis attempt at an animated adaptation of jrr tolkiens masterpiece was a very ambitious project so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production therefore not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made the film itself seems less than finished it seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed but whether or not its intentional is hard to say the whole thing seems shabbily made and undone especially the orcs and the nazgul another problem of course is the huge gaps in the plot bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours the new trilogy by peter jackson does it in about twice that time far too many important bits were left out and i dont refer only to tom bombadil which i think was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie and of course the ending which is completely sudden and out of place im not even sure if bakshi originally intended to end the film there or if he even had any idea where hes going to end itthe characters well most of them were okay the hobbits dont look so bad except for the gay sam did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character if youre a tolkien fanatic like me watch this movie though im not too sure about buying it what special features does the dvd version have anyway but know in advance that youre not going to watch a real lord of the rings movie but not much more than a historical curiosity which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the beatles carried on with their plan i actually think a psychedelic lotr could have been quite cool the idea was to cast george as gandalf paul as frodo ringo as sam and john as gollum if you didnt read the book or didnt like it much or dont like animation films or dont want to see a halffinished movie stay away,0,0,positive,
contains some spoilers this movie is cheesy 80s horror in all its awfulness the plot takes way too long to get off the ground never steadies itself and then just plain crashes about 40 minutes into the film there are a few gem moments for zombie fans but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terrorthe zombies also take a long time to make their appearance first theres a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs the hero of the movie is an exvietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob the main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail in this jail they are experimenting on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal tendencies and criminal behavior but the badie psychotic head scientistmilitary guy has other plans in mind he wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make da da da super soldiers after some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected communion wine the militarycrazy scientist guy goes hey this might be a problem and gives a call to the genius scientist turned investigative journalist hot babe ultraempowered independent woman character who of course invented the original serum she goes to the prison to see whats going down the military guy calls in a few swat teams from his secure position outside the prison and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out the hero guy and the scientistjournalist lady team up to find a cure save the wardens kids and deal with some irate prisoners both infected and not meanwhile the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother the military gets ready to blow the place up and everyone inside scrambles to find a way outthere are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars theres also a creepy decapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner still the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisonerthe main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end the hero woman and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route their path leads them to a long hallway on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through gracing their hair and faces as they pass by theres also a few good scenes of the classic couple of zombies munching on freshly dead bodies and many zombies ripping one guy to shreds bitsoverall worth watching if youre researching the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clichs worth noting its practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie but if youre new to zombie flicks and want a real scare you should look elsewhere,0,0,negative,
this was a very thought provoking film especially for 1973 at the time it was actually a huge box office success after the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten but its central messages were too important to disappear completelyit was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its timeno one had ever heard of the greenhouse effectbefore 1985 and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought upthe sets and special effects might look a little outdated but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period if you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense this is a message movie not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosionsthis was also hestons last good film the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy after that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash this might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made and the ending might be creepy and depressing but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this,1,-1,neutral,

this is definitely a lesser known comedy short from the 1920s the only reason i saw it was because it was on a dvd by kino films featuring nonlaurel and hardy shorts featuring ollie they are interesting and historically important but also generally average to below average for the style film compared to shorts by chaplin keaton arbuckle and lloyd they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor also the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent dvds i ended up turning off the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to set the proper mood but despite this they are still worth seeingive gotta be honest about this short it was the last of 8 on this dvd and by the time i got to it i was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts so it is possible the film might be a little better than a 4but certainly if this is the case no better than a 5 the film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy nothing especially interesting and there are certainly much better silent shorts out there,0,0,negative,
even before this film it is clear to see that ali g has become the exact character he set out to parody i am not a fan of sacha baron cohens character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke a paperthin plot is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes and i must admit i did cringe when i saw such respected thespians as charles dance and michael gambon stoop so low for employment saying that i must admit even if i am quite ashamed to that i did raise a titter on more than one occasion and however bad this film was it was never boring and never once did i consider switching it off mainly due to the gorgeous rhona mitra saying that only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious,0,0,negative,

writer director jay andrews aka jim wynorski serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by gradez computer generated reptiles in komodo vs cobra as generic a ripoff of mysterious island meets jurassic park as you can imagine the chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects the cobra and the komodo are hilariously awful however the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims not that any of this is in the least believable clearly komodo vs cobra had a budget that so low that virtually everything nonhuman in its looks as fake as all get out this cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island where the us military conducts topsecret dna testing on animals the result is that gigantic komodos and cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise as the action opens the primary scientist is gobbled up by a cobra that likes to swim after we are introduced to a group of greenpeace like environmental protesters and a journalist planet one organizer jerry ryan ryan mctavish of hellbent pays charter boat skipper jim stoddard michael pare of cbstvs houston knights five grand with the promise of another five grand if he will take them to this forbidden island meanwhile the us military suspect that something is amiss on the island so they send their own team of men who give eaten by the supersized predators our heroes run into the last remaining scientist on the island dr susan richardson michelle borth of wonderland the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project who tells them that the military is going to target the island for destruction the title match between the two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter hour after our heroes who have been consistently whittled down by the monsters find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island theres no tension suspense or anything worthwhile in this substandard creature feature the best thing about this yawner is composer chuck cirinos orchestral soundtrack it gives komodo vs cobra an epic feel usually jay andrews writes and directs tolerable drivel but this ranks far below his low standards the sexy women fare better at survival than the guys in one scene our heroic group fords a river and we dont get to see any wet tshirts drat theres nothing in the way of memorable dialogue or relationships in this dreck i think that the military guys do far too much saluting when they get their heads together to conspire lets hope that michael pare got a good payday out of this garbage the ending as one of the scientists takes on the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an afterthought its not so bad its good its just bad,0,0,positive,
this movie was well done it covers the difficulties a returning vietnam veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war unfortunately the writers chose to focus on a vet who had been involved in an act of atrocity i was in vietnam and only once heard of such an act by one who witnessed it the offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in leavenworththe notion that only vets involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a disservice to all who served all of the soldiers i knew personally or knew of by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed they were there to halt the spread of communism the biggest problem was coming home to learn that many americans were opposed to the war that is what caused many veterans to feel they had taken part in something less than honorable not the manner in which they servedthe ending depicted the father acting more as a belligerent bully than a loving caring father for that i gave it a 7 out of 10 had the ending allowed for a degree of acceptance i could have rated it a 9most decent men will come home from war with guilt and emotional scars they need acceptance and understanding to overcome that i pray that the public is more understanding of our present day veterans than it was in the the vietnam era,1,-1,neutral,

i want to preface this review by saying that i have no idea what begotten is truly about all i really know is that in the beginning god kills himself in turn birthing mother earth who proceeds to impregnate herself with gods semen she then births a son the rest is pretty subjective and you have to interpret it in your own wayhow i chose to interpret the film was this god killing himself signified the start of the scientific revolution when people started questioning the doctrines imposed by the church like the geocentric view of the universe and etc mother earth symbolized people starting to think for themselves and reject the churchs it happens like this because god says so views the tribal people were the church lashing back at them trying to force christianity down their throats im not exactly sure how son of earth fits into all of this mother earth and the tribal people seemed to be fighting over him so maybe he represents the freedom of people or something to that effecti have no idea what the final parts of this movie are supposed to mean bludgeoning raping then dismembering mother earth and son of earth and grinding them into the ground like a mortar and pestle could mean anything but that is where the fun of this film lies you can interpret it any way you want there doesnt have to be a definitive meaning to it you can let your mind wander sometimes you dont even know what you are supposed to be looking at because it is shot in a weird angle or it is too fuzzythe only thing that disappointed me was that i was expecting a truly terrifying film i was going into it thinking i was going to get a phone call immediately afterward with a foreboding seven days warning what i got was pleasantly different it was not scary at all but it stirred my imagination trying to decipher the movies cryptic message was a creative challenge there were many scenes that were in fact beautiful mother earth just after she was born and the final shot of the forest path come to mindso overall i would have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed this film it is certainly the most abstract movie ive ever seen but thats not a bad thing,1,0,positive,
an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s audiences mustve been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle quite a contrast from his public enemy 2 years earlier cagney does add spark interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline plot but the highlight of the movie is the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back first with the conservative honeymoon hotel numberthen followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling by a waterfall sequencefollowed by the closing shanghai lil sequence cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler the shanghai lil number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown anti climactic after the more exciting incredibly mind boggling by a waterfall choreographyif i was the director i wouldve inserted the shanghai lil number in the middle close with by a waterfallwhich blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak in my view the best of the 3 numbers the 3 production numbers are the frosting on the cake james cagneys performance is added decoration to the cake an outstanding musical achievementa 4 star movie the ultimate musicalwell worth watchingyou wont be disappointed,1,1,positive,

this is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts and undoubtedly christine mcintyres best performance with the trio she is good in a number of other shorts but here she is absolutely brilliant her singing is not funny at all in fact it is downright beautiful but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it we listen to mcintyre sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three times but it never gets old partly because we dont tire of her voice and partly because it blends so well with the stooges antics the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty carlisles role in the marx brothers a night at the opera but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in opera and mcintyre perhaps more in other performances than here exhibited a comedic talent of her own that carlisle never did the stooges buffoonery mcintyres singing and a wellconstructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars,1,1,positive,

this was a strong poirotsuchet television mystery selection the characters were vivid and wellacted the plot and the main settinga student hostel were excellent japp was nothing special but for me did not distract from story one significant point many poirot watchers dont recognize good acting or good characterization i also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the poirot mysteries finally i have read few christie novelsnone in recent years and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel please viewers consider what is presented to you on film not what you think should be there that said the poirot mysteries vary in quality but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe with the singular exception of the five little pigs which was fabulous in plot character and theme the longer poirot films are neither that good or that bad for the record i have seen all the longer poirotsuchet films finally films without lemon hastings andor japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence there presence however is either obtrusive almost always with japp or irrelevant with hastings lemon is in the middle,1,-1,positive,

this norwegian film starts with a man jumping over the subway apparently committing suicide but the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert he meets a man and is shipped off to a mysterious city where he starts working in an aseptic modern office as an accountant the coworkers seem nice if guarded he soon meets a girlfriend yet the city seems utterly strange as food has no taste alcohol doesnt make you drunk and theres nary a children around is this a dream or is he in paradise or in hell while at times the films looks as extended episode of the twilight zone even at ninety minutes the movie seems a bit long it is quite thought provoking the best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal as when the people engage in banal conversations about interior decoration and recoil at discussing deeper issues i always thought there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies in the way they try to repress the basic urges of human nature and this movie is best when it devastatingly critiques this life style unfortunately the movie ends up a big long and the director doesnt seem to know how to end it but most for of the running time this is very much worth seeing,1,-1,positive,

many people thought that this is a good movie but i dont agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i cant see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the soundafter a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long the summary is too short and it cant tell the reviewers about the story clearlyin conclusion i dont think this is a good movie,0,-1,neutral,
william h macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hitman and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents treads much of the same territory as tvs the sopranos in terms of the midlife crisis of a criminal theme here too he visits a shrink but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from brommel i look forward to what this guy directs next an excellent script and all around great performances macy is excellent as always this is probably his best role since fargo donald sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father tracy ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as macys wife young david dorfman is excellent as macys bright and sensitive son many of his lines sound adlibbed and are wonderful even neve campell who i usually find abhorrent is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures macys eye all of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath this film deserved a much wider release as i suspect it would have connected with audiences,1,1,positive,
watching truth about love is this a double entendre about the star is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep you put it in the dvd slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day and it works for that for that purpose being a british romantic comedy it is a bit morethe story is a rather simple one about a wife alice jennifer love hewitt married to an increasingly distant husband sam jimi mistry who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice his partner archie dougray scott is fond of both sam and alice but has a longtime attraction to alice that goes beyond friendship alice pals with her sister felicity kate miles a free love advocate who encourages alice to have affairs on valentines day after a drinking binge with her sister alice mails a card to sam signed anonymous as a test to see if sam responds testing his fidelity at the same time archie mails a radish seed packet to alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not both have ex post facto regrets sam in fact is spending time with a lover katya branka katic and is indeed cheating on alice alice arranges assignations with sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet sam in disguise as anonymous to test his fidelity the entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise of sorts of the fluffy scriptbritish comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting perhaps had director john hay elected to cast a british actress as alice instead of pasting a phony accent on jennifer love hewitt the result may have been improved but in the end this story by peter bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages one terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive there are some nice scenes of london and a few moments of passable humor but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background musicwhite noise grady harp,0,0,positive,

if youre looking for an original horror flick this might be the one for you its strange and at times lingers on stupidity but its just such a good looking nice sounding and original movie it never fails except maybe during the over long climax nightbreed is a must see for horror fans or for fans of monster movie makeupboone craig sheffer has been having dreams of a town called midian full of mutant creatures in therapy his psychiatrist dr decker horror director david cronenberg has come to the conclusion that boone is a murderer and gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to turn himself in after almost getting killed boone ends up at the hospital where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about midian and tells boone where to go midian located in a graveyard is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that dont let boone in after escaping with only a nasty bite boone is shot dead by the police who were lead to his location by dr decker but boone isnt dead the bite causes him to live and he goes off to midian meanwhile boones girlfriend lori anne bobby tries to find boone and get to the bottom of this when dr decker also finds out about this place chaos ensuesthe plot seems long and complicated but it really isnt hard to understand the plot among other things makes this movie really interesting the makeup effects are astounding the creatures look unique and amazing and make this a very appealing film to add to more senses appeal we have a musical score by danny elfman that is both lush and bouncy and fits the film like a glove the shots in the movie are also set up beautifully the cinematography is lovely and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken even the acting is good with the biggest surprise being director david cronenberg giving a great menacing performance as the man who for one reason or another wants to see boone dead its odd for a horror film to be this well donethe problems with the moviewell there are a few but the positives outweigh the negatives the script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor but almost every one falls flat the mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera the worst part of the film would have to be the climax it takes so long and is just constant chaos its the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we dont know or care aboutoverall this movie is amazing to look at its a well done horror film but even with that said it has the occasional failure in characters lines and a messy climax nonetheless this is one to check outmy rating out of 101 mins r for strong violence and language,1,1,positive,
in all truth this really isnt a movie so much as an extended final episode by this i mean that had you not followed the tv series homicide life on the street i suspect that you would have a hard time following this madefortv movie having said that homicide the movie is still a great watch i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program the movie brings out that sense of family not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well its all very bittersweet knowing that this will be the last time we will see them all together again under the title of homicide storywise i found this film somewhat lacking giardellos mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived and i felt his shooting couldve been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position as leiutenant also det baylisss extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but i for one never felt that it needed to be i enjoyed being left with a mystery let us recall that the very first episodes first case also went unsolved for the entire series run as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after hlots had been canceled but i would not recommend it to anyone who hasnt had the slightest exposure to the series now if theyd just release it on dvd,1,1,positive,
quai des orfevres directed by the brilliant henrigeorges clouzot is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of french film making of the postwar years m clouzot adapting the steemans novel longtime defence shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he interconnects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that as dbdumonteil has pointed out in this forum it demonstrates how influential cluzot was and how much the next generation of french movie makers are indebted to the master especially claude chabrolthe crisp black and white cinematography by armand thirard has been magnificently transferred to the criterion dvd we recently watched working with clouzot thirard makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes the music by francis lopez a man who created light music and operettas in france works well in the context of the film since the action takes place in the world of the music halls and night clubslouis jouvet who is seen as a police detective is perfect in the part this was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the french theater jouvet clearly understood well the mechanics for the creation of his police inspector who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others in an unfair comment by someone in this page jouvets inspector is compared with peter falks columbo the television detective frankly and no disrespect to mr falk intended its like comparing a great champagne to a good house winebernard blier is perfect as the jealous husband blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife jenny lamour has awakened in him martineau is vulnerable and doesnt act rationally he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didnt commit but all the evidence points to the contrarythe other great character in the film is dora the photographer its clear by the way she interacts with jenny where her real interest lies simone renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film suzy delair playing jenny is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like brignon the old lecherthe film is one of the best clouzot directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together,1,1,positive,

inglorious basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy gloriously so built on the framework of the dirty dozen inglorious basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of the dirty dozen to plunge into the action right away in the process tarantino fixes one of the dirty dozens major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the nazis were the nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film which ironically makes them even worse monstersbu ditching the training sequences tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war showing us not only british american and german soldiers but also giving us glimpses into the world of french and german civilians both collaborators and resistanceit goes without saying that any tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue but when tarantino made the decision to have the french characters speak french and the germans speak german beyond adding a level of authenticity tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in french was as sharp and funny and clever as his english dialoguecase in point during the opening sequence the nazi jew hunter ss colonel hans landa christian waltz is interrogating french dairy farmer perrier lapadite denis menochet landa suspects that lapadite is hiding a family of jews while subtly pressuring lapadite landa asks for a glass of milk after greedily gulping it down landa compliments lapadite on his daughters and his cows votre famille et vos vaches je dis bravo the thing of it is in french vache means cow but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina if reprimanded for this vulgar pun landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand french well enough to have meant it that way but landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat and lapadite understands his meaning all too wellthat is a really subtle piece of acting and wordplay that many audiences would never catch or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat the film is rich with that kind of detail all of the french and english dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while i cant swear to the german i would suspect that it shows a similar level of craftinglorious basterds opens with the phrase once upon a time in nazioccupied france personally this reminds me of the opening of every asterix book and movie another comic fantasy in a wartorn occupied france like asterix inglorious basterds is howlingly funny in places although the film also turns darkly seriousin its more serious moments inglorious basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax as in almost every elongated sequence of the film tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levelstarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous even inflammable and that its power deserves respectif you can see this film as i did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen if you are not that lucky all that you will see is a great great film that delivers a darkly funny punch,1,1,positive,

being a fan of the game and watching this film made me physically vomitit was an awful film though the story was similar to the games plot the whole super human soldiers thing other than that jack carver an all american man in the game is played by a germen unless thats some sort of twisted irony that is what made me pull a middle finger at my tv screen the second it started the fact that you can tell its filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed like the middle of summer this is uncalled for because the game is set in the tropical rain forest whereas this looks like the director just looked out his window in the morning and went thats a good forestthis is a note to all directors if you ever plan to make a film based on a gamebook play it understand it and ask fans about it dont just play it for an hour and assume you know it,0,0,negative,
dietrich bonhoeffers writings have had a profound influence on my life as a christian and i eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life words can hardly express my disappointment this movie was disjointedit gave no background about his life no historical context and nothing about his great writings except a brief passing reference to the cost of discipleship by a colleague at the beginning of the movie instead we see him enjoying jazz apparently in the states and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to germany apparently to show his human side ok im ready for the dramatic part the part where he stands up for his faith instead of emphasizing that we get a very badly acted romance with a 17yearold schoolgirl whether or not that actually took place it should not have been a major portion of the movie nowstill waiting for the dramatic part or some narration explaining what his writings were all aboutor something to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man drumrollwaiting waitingzip nada this is the kind of movie that gives christian films a bad name all they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow with some backgroundeven some voiceovers or flashbacks to him preaching from his workssome narrative about who he was and where he had been but nothis is what we got hardly fitting for a hero of the faith,0,-1,positive,
this could be the most underrated movie of its genre i dont remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didnt do so well at the box office however frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie i rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my listmovie begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself gods hand and then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case during that trip the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began fenton and adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who one day claims that he has received a divine message from god asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings he receives from god a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine missionthis is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat the tension runs high innocent people or demons get killed and religious experiences are questioned it has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end if you like this genre i highly recommend frailty for you i own the dvd and it is one of my all time favorite horrorthrillers,1,1,positive,

i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine his sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner a bit of axel foley through the looking glass charlotte lewis is to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable luminously gorgeous some scenes are wonderfully created the dream sequence the bird the silly fight scenes and the climactic confrontation through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth a stunned and quieter version of kurt russell in his oriental fantasy romp like that movie we have james hong the incomparable actor whose scenes however short raise the quality even of derek since 1955 hong has defined the fine supporting actor the class act of his profession the golden child is silly it is not perfect but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy well worth watching after four years i have seen the golden child again i enjoyed it even more it truly is great fun,1,1,positive,

written by directed by and starring the champ of camp bruce campbell easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair filmed independently in bulgaria all i can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny campbell plays an affluent american business man with a cheating wifeantoinette byronand trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered he hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town not knowing that his wife is carrying on with the taxi driver within moments of campbell being bludgeoned the cabbie is killed in the same location a mad scientiststacy keachproceeds with an experiment putting the cabbies brain inside the americans head with massive stitches on his forehead campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his oversized head campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself thus bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased i get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy rounding out the cast are ted raimi tamara gorski and vladmir kolev watch for this on the scifi channel,0,-1,positive,
this is the page for house of exorcism but most people have confused this film with the mario bava masterpiece lisa the devil which explains the ridiculously high rating for this house of exorcism when lisa the devil was shown at film festivals in the early 70s it was a critical success audiences responded well to that gorgeous gothic horror film unfortunately it was a bit ahead of its time and was considered too unusual and not commercial enough for mass consumption no distributor would buy it so producer alfredo leone decided to edit lisa seemingly with a chainsaw by removing just about half of the original film and adding new scenes which he filmed two years after the original product it is important to note that bava had little to do with these new hideous additions so technically house of exorcism is not a bava film the original product is a slow dreamy classy production a few minutes into the film the viewer is jarred out of this dream world as suddenly we see lisa two years older and with a very different haircut begin to writhe on the ground making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like suck my cok etc subtle huh and the film continues like this jumping back and forth between a beautiful visual film and a grade z exorcist ripoff leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes while keeping some semblance of a story intact he failed miserably when the choice was made to basically destroy lisa and the devil bava himself refused saying that his film was too beautiful to cut he was right and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet it was many years before the original lisa and the devil was seen again resurfacing on late night television i had seen lisa long before i saw this new version and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films vandalised in this way worth seeing only for curiosity sake otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague,0,-1,neutral,

now i have seen a lot of movies in my day but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me and im a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies almost all the acting is believable the graphics are decent for which you wont even be caring about as you watch the movie trust me bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do the story is well written and its a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kidsheres basically what this movie made me to it one made me laugha lot two made me feel for the characters like youre suppose to and three its a very uplifting story by the end of this movie you will feel good sure what anime out there hasnt featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil its a formula that is used a lot but in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics youd see 5 years ago the appearance of it is not to be judged its very touching the ending is original and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to if you however try comparing this to other movies like the neverending story or whatever it will diverse your opinion watch it as it is and you will enjoy itit has been a good long while since ive been impressed like this the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it so dont overanalyze or take this movie too seriously just enjoy it,1,1,positive,
zombie bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the horror genre as i understand it from the commentary and things i have read it was made during the huge midwest flood of 1993 when half of missouri was underwater buildings were under water cars and houses were underwater one article said that zombies and the crew from this movie would help sandbag the river after shooting each day the fact this movie got made at all is a miracle it is like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made put through a troma filter it is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and goofy characters and it is fast paced and energetic and really funnya toxic spill accident in a nuclear power facility causes people to melt down or turn into zombies the local government covers it up tears down the factory and builds houses over it some ground shifting causes a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and unleash the undead on the newly built community from there it just gets crazy and gory and funi have read these reviews on here a few times and it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times as a different reviewer using fake names they use the same words and sentences zombie bloodbath is cheap it is raw it has some bad acting so does half the movies made there is much much worse out there than this fun movie if you hate this film so much dont buy it there is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast trailer trash and it is obvious you are not from australia or england it is just upsetting that this great service the imdb does not catch people using it just to trash others there are bad reviews and good reviews and i dont mind those i give both bad and good reviews myself but it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie sadsome of these so called reviewers even basically sue their review just to promote their own movies one called this film boring well love it or hate it one thing you can never say about this film is that it is boring it moves fast and never has a dull spotoh and this reviewer from the netherlands um liar you tried to post this same review at amazon and it got yanked there the same review only it said it was from missourithis nonsense has to stop love it or hate it give it a real review or type nothing it is obvious you have not seen the filmsbut for the record i have and though this one is not nearly the best that i have seen it is far from the worst and even the worst i would give an actual revoew and would not attack the director personallyhope this review helps some people see through the stupidity going on here,1,0,positive,
abderrahmane sissako may have known what he was doing when he made bamako but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have beenthe nominal plot involves a young african singer whos planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city but far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as a mock trial against key financial institutions dealing with the overwhelming economic hardships of africa thats all well and good i suppose but when the arguments and ideas are put forth in as undramatic and pedantic a way as they are here they lose both force and impact put another way if the director had found the means to actually incorporate issues such as the injurious effect of colonialism on the african people and the problem of african debt into anything even remotely resembling a compelling storyline the film might have achieved the intellectual and emotional resonance it now so clearly lacksthe topics the movie is dealing with may be relevant and important but trying to pass off what amounts to two hours worth of speechifying as an actual honesttogod movie is not likely to garner much of an audience for ones message,0,-1,neutral,

i caught this film at the edinburgh film festival i hadnt heard much about it only that it was a tightlypaced thriller shot digitally on a very low budget i was hoping to catch the next big britflick but i have to say i was severely disappointed this is not a love song follows two criminals who after accidentally shooting and killing a farmers young daughter become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them downthe real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a british film the camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story as are the over the top performances and the appalling use of slow motion which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video there are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty which instead come over as hilarious and over the topcue a pathetic obligatory drug scene and countless pointless camera zooms no amount of cliches such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad storyweve seen this kind of thing many times before and made a hundred times better particularly in john boormans masterful deliverance but while in the latter film we actually cared about the characters in this film i found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible even this wouldnt have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile but instead are merely a collection of stereotypical inbredlooking countryfolk again another offensive overused cliche coming to the fore surely there are some nice people in the country filmmakersin its defense this is not a love song does contain a couple of good suspenseful moments but its hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video or at a push getting a very limited cinema release its not a patch on last years lowbudget hunted in the hills movie dog soldiers maybe british cinema could actually get kickstarted again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people,0,0,positive,

i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies or cinema i dont remember were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon it really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over itabout 18 or so years later the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4dvd set of treasures of american film archives released by the national film preservation foundation so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs after all these years i could finally see the film after viewing it it slightly wasnt was i was expecting it to be it tended to be a more organiclooking film not that thats a bad thing but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic but it was still an impressive film imho considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film including handtinting the film itself and using video equipment for some of the films scenes filmed off of a video monitor giving it a more distressed lores lookdont get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite groundbreaking for 1972 thats why its still one of my favorite shortexperimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well,1,0,negative,

shohei imamauras black rain was released in 1989 just at the onset of the aids epidemic a fact that gives the film about the slow deterioration of hiroshima radiation victims an added poignancy the black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash radioactive fallout and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion there have been other books and films about the dropping of the atomic bomb but none as unique and powerful as this one based on a novel by masuji ibuse who gathered information from interviews and the diaries of reallife bomb victims the film depicts how an entire family is affected psychologically as well as physically by the bomb years after the original explosion it is a horrifying vision but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity the film begins in hiroshima on august 6 1945 as soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderous blast is heard almost every single building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair the first atomic bomb ever dropped on a city is now a part of history survivors must somehow restart their lives unaware of the bombs devastating after effects filmed in highcontrast black and white the story centers around yasuko yoshiko tanaka a young woman who is caught in the radioactive rain as her boat heads back to the city to search for friends and relatives in hiroshima imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us a young boy with skin hanging from his body pleads with his brother to recognize him an older man is in tears over his inability to free his son from piles of debris a mother is in torment as she rocks the blackened body of her childwhen the family returns to their rural home yasukos life is forever changed she sees her friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable bouts of radiation sickness that have already affected her uncle shigematsu shimuza kazuo kitamura and aunt shigeko shimuza etsuko ichihara pretending that there is only business as usual the family denies that the bomb has affected yasuko she forgot how hiroshima and nagasaki were destroyed everyone forgot it they forget the hell of fire and go to rallies like an annual festival im sick of it says a friend katayama akiji kobayashi yasuko internalizes the tragedy feeling shame for being different than others and guilty for being contaminatedwhen her aunt and uncle try to find her a husband the eligible men refuse to marry her because of suspicions about her health even though shigematsu has copied her diary to prove that she wasnt directly exposed to the bomb the only suitor she feels comfortable with is another damaged man yuichi keisuke ishida who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine at the end the beauty of life shows itself ever so fleetingly when yasuko goes to the pond and sees a sight she has been longing for all her life the king carp jumping in the water playfully as if to say that beyond despair there is still joy sadly we hear on the radio statements by politicians about using the bomb once again in the korean war human beings learn nothing says shigematsu they strangle themselves unjust peace is better than a war of justice why cant they see immamuras black rain has hopefully allowed all of us to see more clearly,1,-1,neutral,

well this latest version of mansfield park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story unfortunately the result is a rather lackluster and schizophrenic production and as with all the other versions of mansfield park out there the character of fanny price is no where to be found instead there is a strangely childlike bleachedblond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character at least in the 1999 movie the character they call fanny price is firmly established as rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own good this fanny price is a complete enigma someday i would really like to see a dramatization of mansfield park that actually includes a depiction of the character of fanny as she was written by jane austen a sweet kind compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution she is reserved in manner and painfully honest but also strong in her convictions unfailingly loyal extremely intelligent and remarkably astute a bit of a late bloomer it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to selfpossessed young woman and she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most its a wonderfully complex character that i look forward to one day seeing faithfully portrayed,0,1,positive,

rabbit fever is one of those film oddities its an enjoyable 90 minutes demands little of the viewer and delivers as much and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot i think that rabbit fever would be rather well received which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemasthe movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the rabbit vibrator the film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product the narrative is 100 tongue in cheek throughoutthe storyline is strong an introduction to some well rounded and likable characters some enjoyable backstory peripheral characters and situations develops into an engaging story and pleasing conclusions sadly theres nothing that feels clever or new rabbit fever has some sharp moments a few switches that hint at what the writers are capable of and all credit to them its not just 90 minutes of knob gags and innuendo i could probably watch it with my mother but theres a laziness about some of the scenes that holds it back those moments went you are up for it when you want it to be outrageous and all you get is a dollop of sitcomi chuckled i left the theatre feeling empathy for the characters but i also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute reel of made for tv light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema i think rabbit fever achieves some of what it set out to do its a quirky subject a rounded storyline a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes but theres nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a movie theatre environment quite the opposite a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer chance to grab a breath of life that rabbit fever seems to lack,0,-1,neutral,
having worked professionally with young girls on the run i found this film surprisingly authentic i would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape there are classic themes here coming of age motherdaughter estrangement the limited choices of the underprivileged who is the good samaritan tragedy is in every life the many layers or relationships flashbacks are meaningful when alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it and it does not end in clich the cast really sells their roles it is adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy allow it 15 minutes to so to draw you in,1,-1,neutral,
okay you hippies are probably wondering what i have against an education and informative show like barney well i have a lot of hate against it for these reasons1 it teaches that having a personality and individualism is immoral no one on the show has a personality everyone dresses alike talks alike acts alike and dances alike even in the episode called being an individual kids try to tell barney about what they like and everyone on the planet should do what i like do you wanna teach your kid that being an individual is wrong2 a stranger is a friendyou havent met episode while seemingly harmless the shows producers soonfound that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children in fact several young barneylovers from across the us fell victim to pedophiles who were using the shows friendly message to lure children away from their parents the episode has since been pulled but the damage had been done so called innocent mistakes in programming like this one clearly show why parents need to watch television with their children3 if your not happy all the time you are a bad person no one seems to show any other emotion but happiness no matter which situation they are in if the childs parents get mad or sad for some reason the child may think of mommy or daddy differently not a good message at all4 magic solves everything seems like every problem is solved by magic at least in shows like fraggle rock it teaches us that magic can backfire at it is best to solve problems on your own does barney teach this no of course not there has to be magic in there and the problem is a lot of two year olds cannot tell fantasy from reality and might think their parents siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything yet become confused when they cannot use magic and think they are weird another boner pulled again5 barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing he has even specifically said that stealing is okay if the person you steal from doesnt mind kids can learn that if you really want something stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it this is not something that preschoolers need authority figures to tell them6 if i just have the right thing i can solve all my problems whenever the kids have a problem barney gives them whatever they need to solve it the message being sent here is dont try to think to solve this its too much work and the solution probably wouldnt work anyway just use this because of this children could stop thinking through things barney said it was too much work and become dependent on the right object the right shoes the right food the right computer the right exercise machine this is obviously a good message for the barney marketers but its not good for preschoolers7 the message that cheating is okay in another episode the children are involved in a contest to carry a peanut on a spoon without dropping it one child puts peanut butter on his spoon and easily wins the child is then rewarded for his creative thinking when the child in fact bent the rules and changed the game so that he could win this teaches that cheating is good you win and people think that you are creative when in real life you will often be disqualified or worse and severely disliked by other competitors who played by the rules8 do the kids in this show eat anything else besides cakes cookies and candy that teaches that it is okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food despite barneys so called health food song other than that everyone in the show eats junk food no wonder there are so many obese kids in america and europeand finallymost other kids television shows teach creative problem solving well without having to resort to magic barney could also have done that but instead decided to use the method that was a best for the marketers and b took the least time and money for scripts its a blatant sellout that shows just how little the lyons group actually cares about childrenthat is my rant for you all,0,0,positive,
why this is called mistresses is a puzzle because its about four women three of whom arent mistresses except wait ah i see its a salacious title and we all have to merchandise i suppose the series itself delicious most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves great fun reminds me of lwts 1976 miniseries bouquet of barbed wire where every character and their dads wielded the machetesiobhan orla brady is the only actual mistress and shes getting herself in proper trouble husband is infertile so no chance of a baby there then but at work theres dominic played by ubersexy adam rayner who looks so good that theres no surprise when heavy lust breaks out dominic it turns out has no fertility problems i expect his sperms do swashbuckling probably each carries a little sword and now siobhan is inevitably pregnant that way instead what siobhan should do is to shut up good and tight and go with its a miracle what she actually does of course is say to her friends i have to tell my husband no you dont really you dont stop stopkatie sarah parish was a mistress once for we learn that shed had an affair with a married man before the series started unwisely shes now taken up with his son the father died of cancer and katie who is a doctor helped him on his journey so shes an euthanasiarist has had affairs with two of her patients and is sleeping with the son of the father in carelessly ignoring the incestuous undertones its not going to end well for katiejessica is an experimental lesbian she arranges events and shes busy doing a lesbian marriage as the series gets underway she quickly gets into steamy eye exchanges with one of the brides alex played by anna torv and the script hurries along to a lesbonk with great haste however it cant think of a good way of putting the two women in bed together so it invents a very lame youre not having a hen night well i cant let you get away with that ill organise one and the guests shall be me which achieves the result but isnt exactly winterson i thought script writers were supposed to earn their living lazy torvs interpretation of her character is good alex treats jessica as possibly unsavoury and alexs body language always points backwards when shes moving forward mind once shes over the wall in she happily goes and unsurprisingly for shelley conn is so mouthwatering that so would a good percentage of the human race given the chancewhich brings us to trudi whos a widow of course there should be plain people in a community but if youre going to have a plain character then you have to invent something to admire in them its quite possible to be a lump and engaging however smalls trudi looks like one of those characters that casting put prominently in a medieval crowd scene after the director said thats ridiculous not every single character would be pretty more tellingly you cant find anything to admire in her nothing shes a turnip in a bowl of apples appallingly she does sexy from time to time i wont forget her appearance in bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time and for all the wrong reasonsso good delinquent fun all round theres easily enough material here for a second series and i hope that they do one i trust they learn one lesson though the characters never take off their underclothes in bed having spent abandoned hours of unbridled lust afterwards they surface still wearing their bras or keep the sheets tight wound round their naughty bits after several episodes no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock whats this early 21st century puritanism so production team are you listening your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they do abandon as well as talk it at least theyll have more fun in the fun scenes poor things in a series dominated by either being in the bedroom or wanted to be in the bedroom or having just been in the bedroom its a bit silly and jars a lot that the characters bonk in their underwearoverall i was going to score 6 top end medium but the series does one trick thats rare enough when each episode ends you always want more and you look forward to the next one with anticipation so i score 7,1,-1,positive,

watching this hilariously retro but very entertaining career girl tale i was floored by joan crawfords first appearance all i could think initially was my god its the same face as michael jackson in his notorious booking photo about 34 minutes into the movie diane baker and hope lange get out of a cab in greenwich village as they walk down the street you can see part of a sign in back of them for the stonewall bar scene of the epochal riots that are considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movementspeaking of baker and taxis i had to laugh when she gets into one and tells the cabbie 56th and sutton place please and be careful of the bumps can you imagine the reaction to that from a driver in todays manhattan she says that of course because shes pregnant and doesnt want to hurt the fetus but that doesnt stop her from jumping out of a moving car when she finds out bob evans wants her to have an abortion well they had to find a way for her to lose the baby 1959 and allsue carson is delightful as mary agnes why was this her only movie there is no biographical information on her in imdb,1,-1,neutral,
when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long i thought we were in trouble condensing the gigantic w somerset maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen but you know the movies not half bad and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readersive heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet noodle of an actor and he was but i cant think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet noodle for thats certainly what carey is howard plays him well which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly then finally take him out and buy him a spineah and then theres bette as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him i didnt know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book and the movie stays true to that detail but as played by davis she does become the most fascinating character in the story and if shes nasty and unlikable shes at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time daviss performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting much as brandos would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out stella in that littleknown tennesee williams play and its not hard to see why davis is intense to the point of scary she makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that its an std is shocking of course it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect if it had been made a year later you can bet things would have been a bit differentyes much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts are left on the cutting room floor and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of maughams novel but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they didgrade b,1,0,negative,

being an admitted chess addict i was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between garry kasparov and ibms deep blue supercomputer i was hoping to see an in depth look at the match and a lot of what kasparov had to say boy was i wrong and misguided by a mile this documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries there is a lot of flash but no real substance after watching it i am sad to say i felt like i wasted my time one of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time it has the typical mtv type editing where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds it is very sad that filmmaking has been watered down to the attention span of a 10year old childi understand it is difficult to make a film about chess but that does not mean one should make it flashy game over did have a couple of interesting ideas though it brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not whether computers have advanced to a unique new level this is what kasparov thought after the match but this film does not go deep enough with this idea also this film tries to bring in a bizarre theory it tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer kasparov had suspicions about this but still to this day there is no evidence towards the end of the film it tries to imply the bizarre that maybe anatoly karpov might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of deep blue interesting to think about but i dont know how plausible or realistic it is i still would not recommend this movie though not even for chess addicts,0,-1,neutral,

although i really enjoyed jim carreys latest serious performances the truman show man on the moon ive always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy this is not to say he is a fantastic talented actor those bozos at the academy awards seem to dislike him so much he has never had a truly deserved nomination or award well any institution that nominates for 11 oscars a bore such as titanic shouldnt be taken seriouslyon with the review the grinch is the sweetest best looking best acted more enjoyable seasons film since the nightmare before christmas both movies seem very similar too with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing christmas both make their principal actors seem like the villains one in a higher degree than the other both pack a strong moral lesson and both are truly enjoyablethat is until you realize that jack skellington is a doll and the grinch is a human being but a human being that is so incredibly expressive so fluid in his movements so cartoonlike so unreal that never gets in the way of the movie he can be hilarious he can be a sad soul he can be angry he lives in a 3dimensional world where 3dimensional people live he jokes he laughs he cries and ultimately he saves the christmas i loved this film to bits and cannot wait for it to come out on dvd this is one of those films you will really enjoy 10 20 years from now as timeless as they come,1,1,positive,

ive heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television miniseries planet earth narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough nevertheless whether it was screened down here in australia or not i never caught up with it and when i happened upon the opportunity to see earth 2007 a featurelength compilation of the same nature footage on the big screen i jumped at the chance the theatre was basically empty just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me and it was as though i had not only the big screen to myself but indeed the entire planet earth for 90 minutes i was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film awesome in its scope and yet painfully intimate at times earth is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinctionthough the film directed by alastair fothergill and mark linfield obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether indeed there is not a human in sight instead we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world to experience the resilience and also the fragility of life on earth i hear that the original miniseries which ran for eleven episodes delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems but i think that here the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact i cant remember the last time that i felt so inspired and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals anthropomorphising them to an extent we are suddenly able to appreciate the human side of each species and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedyearth is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the arctic ice or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the lifesaving seasonal floodwaters of the okavango delta the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predatorprey interactions though occasionally perhaps to cater towards a younger audience the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment i regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature and the raw instinct that fuels these animals final hopeless efforts at survival theres even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt both in the slowmotion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey the result of a single fateful misstep or the majestic midair leap of a great white shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion it is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own speciesaside from these main stories we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world including the birds of paradise of papua new guinea and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes of course entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear elephant and humpback whale tracing their lifestyles via some astonishing highdefinition timelapse photography throughout a calender year the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show and only 90 minutes to show it consequently earth left me thirsting for more and fortunately i now have approximately eleven hours more as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd boxset for planet earth uplifting and tearjerking aweinspiring and heartrending earth is a truly magnificent documentary experience and it might just be my favourite film of 2007,1,1,positive,
this movie was really interesting it also is quite shocking as the similar events of the movie occurred only 10 months after the movie premieredit was interesting seeing the problems that could be encountered and realistic enough to show that no matter how prepared you think you are you arent if this was made for an american audience it would be different because they would have used this as a full propaganda film and not as a wake call which the bbc did it still is propaganda in some extend no film today with these themes can not be but it dealt with the issue successfullya film that should be shown in all terrorismcounterterrorism courses but will not because it shows faults which is not allowed to be acknowledged a great film in which the bbc took a few risks and unfortunately london does not need a fictional tale any more due to the reality of july 7 2005,1,1,positive,
hindsight is a wonderful thing much reviled when it first appeared inspiring the famous review me no leica this precursor of cabaret can now be looked at in comparison and its not half bad its certainly no classic but it has its own wayward charm the film version of cabaret follows this plot whereas the stage version changed the plot somewhat one should of course resist the temptation to snicker when laurence harveys christopher isherwood it keeps the original authors real name god knows what isherwood thought of it describes himself as a confirmed bachelor and while harvey is an utterly inadequate hero hes virtually asexual and shelly winters woefully miscast as fraulien landauer the part marisa berenson played in cabaret julie harris is a perfectly marvellous sally its a lovely piece of comic acting and anton diffring is firstrate as fritz the germanjew in love with shellys character of course if cabaret had never come along you might ask yourself would this ever have seen the light of day again that it has been revived may not quite be cause for celebration but its perfectly acceptable all the same,1,-1,positive,
the centerpiece of lackawanna blues is the character rachel nanny crosby who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy ruben the narrator of the film based upon the experiences of writeractor ruben santiagohudson the film lovingly recreates the upstate new york boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s the first half of the film is virtually nonstop music the second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse nannys ability to take fragments and make them whole affects everyone within her sphere an especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband telling him firmly if you ever touch that child again were going to dance as delivered by actress s epatha merkerson that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hairtrigger temper is frozen in his tracks from start to finish merkerson delivers a commanding presence her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home this was a touching heartfelt film with a wonderful cast as played by merkerson the character of nanny simply radiates love this is a film experience that i will remember for a long time to come,1,1,positive,
god zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as tarzan and probably had about as many actors in the title role this serial is one of my own personal favourites and as previously statedit is one of the top 5 sound serials oddly enough this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939 by the time of this production in 39 zorro was really well known as a pulp literary and movie character the film opens up with a little foot note about the history of the mexicos struggle for freedom from rule by a european monarchy namely spain the story invites comparison with the american revolutionary warthe story concentrates its attention to the mythical province of san mendelito and its council it is being addressed by benito juarezon their gold mines relation to the new republic of mexico gold shipments must get thru to mexico citydon francisco uncle to diego vega states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoysa thug from the don del oro mob stages an insult to himself and challenges don francisco to a duel with swords don frasncisco getting run throughsuddenly the dark clad masked swordsman appears to sword fight and after carving the trademark z on the face of the bad guy he dispatches him to the hereafter don francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward ramon william corson that zorro is his nephew from the city of los angeles he also attempts to tell of the true identity of don del oro but expires before completing statementthere is a big reception for diego at don franciscos hacienda where diego disappoints ramonsister also ward of don francisco with his timid act a fop she declareslaterdiego and ramon slip away to join up with a meeting of the volunteers when they ask who will lead us with don francisco now dead ramon declares zorro we are zorros fighting legion well there is a big battle with the legion now all clad on gray with masks and capes protecting the gold train then zorro seems trapped at a manmade avalanche intended for the convoy when well you know cliffhanger end of chapter onewow that was a lot of writing for one chapter but like most other serials the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line lets just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good well made action filled chapters followingzorros fighting legion has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action we have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting trouble between different groups there is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of don del oro we had soldiers renegade whites hostile indians and the legionin short its safe to say that there is everything one could want and then some in this serial and incidentally they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any mexican accentsas to just what is there here that makes zfl stand out from the rest what makes it different or unique wellfirst of all it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on the screen the opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the cantina in chapter one this is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in serial sound trackand yet there is one more feature that really sets the fighting legion saga out in front from all others that is the film not only has a heroic musical theme but it also sports lyrics yes the legionairres sing we hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters it really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewingwhen the serial was first shown on our local television circa 1955 all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of reed hadley as belonging to captain braddock from racket squad the tv series mr hadley had a very distinctive deep voice he also handled the role very well his costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functionalthere is a small slip up a sort of minor anachronism occurs by having benito juarezcarleton youngaddressing the san mendelito council as juarez was about 18 years old at this time 1824 and though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in mexicos history he surely hadnt achieved such prominence yet his inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of warner brothers juarez that year which starred paul muni in the title rolethis is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial but also my favourite zorro film we are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year what with gone with the wind mrsmith goes to washington the citadel juarez the wizard of oz of mice and men one million bczenobia we want our mummy all counted among the output that year once again juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850 about 25 years later also the political subdivisions are referred to as provinces in the story in actuality they are called states just as we are called the united states of america so toosouth of the border they call their repubhlic the united states of mexico reed hadley was prominent in some very a pictures in which his richly toned voice is exploited to good effect watch listen for his narration in the house on 92nd street 1945 and guadalcanal diary 1945,1,-1,positive,
ride with the devil has something rich and special if you can stand the slow development while tackling a dark gritty subject the brutal guerrilla war in the american west during its civil war which in turned spawned the outlaws of the old west of the 1870s the movie maintains a strangely satisfying unmanipulated atmosphere what im refering to is the tendency of films music and lighting to make you feel the mood youd expect to feel but rwtd instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewers sensesas an enthusast of this particular area of cw history im greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film the diologue is expertly written even with subtle humor occasionally with references to bushwhackers and previous boarder battles independence for examplea far cry from the oregon trail the minor events that occur to jakes band are similar to actual events that took placeespecially the attack when theyre holed up in the house and the destruction of the storebooth the battle scenes though rare are pretty well executed it even has the first cw cavalry battle put on film recentlythe directing shows the talent everyone expects of ang lee in subtle ways example the character of black john is shown taunting a lawrence resident during the massacre wheres your army who are we to fight who are we to fight the shot then switches to a trio of confederate regulars standing doing nothing to stop the carnage while the voice continues you are cowards all who are the cowards really little touches like that really enhance the movies qualitythere are no major glaring areas in the history something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film glory which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented dont add up but you will never notice that a larger curiosity is the fact that the only africanamerican manatarms character in the film is the quasislave fighting for jake and his confederate bushwhackers it is true that some blacks did fight for the confederacy out there including one who scouted lawrence for quantrill before the attack who would suspect him though this black rebel is a fasinating character whatever pc africanamericans might think of him not a single black union infantryman is seen in the film which would have been more represenative of the black experience in the western cw one of the first black regiments of the cw was raised in kansas by the murderer senator jim lane and before the 54th mass reg of fame was organized and black troops in such battles as baxter springs ks played a critical roleno glaring historical errors good realistic action which is infrequent and not gratitous good directing this film may not be the blockbusters other recent civil war were but its the cleanest job of any,1,1,positive,
well when before i saw this film i really wasnt sure whether it would be my cup of teahow wrong i was i thought that this was one of the best films ive watched for a very long time a real family classic the story of a young evacuee and his new foster dad this film ticks all the boxes ive not read the book maybe thats a good thing meant i enjoyed the film more but with regards to the story i really cant think of any bad points hence scoring it 10 out of 10 and i hardly ever think anything warrants top marks by the time william proclaimed i can ride my bike dad i was sobbing my heart out anyone whos seen it will understand im sure really heartwarming and definitely recommended,1,0,positive,
the wind easily one of the worst films ever made the only good that comes from this kind of pointless drivel is the fact that seeing films like this get distribution makes indy horror filmmakers like me confident that my upcoming feature will make the cut too i mean if this represents the market for indy horror i could make a fortune videotaping myself taking out the garbage for 83 minutes a complete list of what this film lacks would take way too long to write out but the highlites are no story terrible acting awful cinematography and virtually no editing that last one bothered me the most as an editor myself this film drove me absolutely crazy because it had almost no editing at all every scene was shot in a master they had absolutely no coverage at all for anyone who doesnt knowcoverage is shooting a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when editing to make for a desirable viewing experience yeah this movie had none of that im talking about even the simplest of scenes example an ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would typically start out with a master establishing whos in the scene and where they are then as the conversation goes on you would cut back and forth to overtheshoulder shots as the conversation continues you may even throw in a cutaway shot or two of something on the table or in someones hand anything this is film 101 stuff guys it seems as though these people had no idea this is how films work every shot was a camera lockdown no movement no cutting no nothing if i was teaching a course in filmmaking this would be the visual aid for my what not to do lessonin closing dont waste your time folks the only amazing this about this film is that it ever scored distribution at all,0,0,positive,

this movie had so much potential to be hilarious yet moving but fell way short of either it had a great story line it just was not executed as good as it could have been the weird hallucinations during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense and definitely was not needed they made no impact nor did they enhance or lend any understanding of what was to come or happenjon heders character was ok but could have been expanded upon more he played the crappy part he was given at his best the character was funny but again it fell short of what could have beenmilas character was perfect and her performance was spot onin closing the writing was horrible and more often than not made no sense and his hallucinations did not fit with the movie at all this movie with better scripting and directing could have been a contender to national lampoons vacation as far as funny bad things happening to a person on a trip across americainstead it was only worthy of a second flush if i would have seen this at the theater i would have demanded my money back and boycotted the filmthe only thing that this film did was waste an hour and a half of my life it also managed to make all those involved in the movie look bad simply because the movie was a stinkeri do not recommend this movie to anyone ever,0,0,positive,

unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite out of fear of blackmail peter boyle makes this film with his foul mouthed boorish portrayal of a working class stiff joe in love with the past and fearful of the future and worried about the present the first half hour of the show features the film debut of a young susan sarrandon as melissa compton a weak willed rich girl who slums with her loser boyfriend replete with a full nude scene her boyfriend is the films weak spot a poorly portrayed drug addict and dealer who meets his demise following sarrandons overdose we meet boyles joe in a bar as he spouts off and rants about minorities crime hippies and drugs and it is easy to see that the later norman lear television character of archie bunker is based on a cleaned up version of joe the comparison even carries over into joes wife and personal life and pastimes joe insinuates himself into the life of bill compton melissas father and the two make an unlikely pair as they search for melissa who has run away from drug treatment and back to the drug addicts she calls friends their search leads them to an oargee as joe calls it a free love fest fueled by drugs a lot of nudity and surprisingly uptight bill compton and ultra conservative joe both join in they get robbed and this leads to a violent and murderous ending that foreshadows the stark and chilling ending to taxi driver six years later joe is a funny film that on the surface at least is anti violence and anti racist yet the films main character joe becomes the very instrument of the upheaval he fears when he enters and joins in the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses he rants against so in that respect the film falls short of being a powerful message and leaves you wondering what the final outcome really was all about,1,0,positive,

in retrospect the 1970s was a golden era for the american cinema as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by ted demme and richard lagravenese this ifc effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of what that time meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentarythe amazing body of work that remains is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movies in that period the decade was marked by the end of the viet nam war and the turbulent finale of those years of jimmy carters presidencyone thing comes out clear films today dont measure against the movies that came out during that creative decade because the industry as a whole has changed dramatically the big studios nowadays want to go to tame pictures that will be instant hits without any consideration to content or integrity as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in revenuesthe other thing that emerges after hearing some of americas best creative minds speak is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is about the only thing that afford its creators great moral and artistic rewardsthis documentary is a must see for all movie fans,1,1,positive,

there is an interesting split in the voting for this movie at the moment at least those who go expecting a documentary are impressed or at least not disappointed i anticipate that those giving the film 1 out of 10 are those who expected a war movie or a reenaction of the invasion of gallipoliso if you want to see actors gunfire and gore this film will not suit you if you want to see an independent documentary about gallipoli without bias towards any one side the only enemy in these events was the war itself then youll come away both impressed and sobered i found it a very moving film and even quite liked captain guy nightingale by the end,1,-1,neutral,

i should put out an alert all over saying that the movie shouldnt be watched it fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men the special effect were horrible i hadnt expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology how can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 110th the speed how can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them how can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away how come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itselfnot only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder there were the standard dialogues like ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai ise laath mat maro and pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to hindustaan me hai and loc cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai stupid to say the leastwhat shobha de had written is true the director worked without a script and it shows there is no flow to the movie there is no gradual progression from one battle to another it is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war the explanatory scenes are awful the chief of army staff looks unconvincing to make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours,0,0,negative,

really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statementsa perfect example is when the filmmaker claims saul or paul of tarus the writer of the book of hebrews he asserts has no idea jesus is or was a human being this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting or he is ignorant of what the bible saysfirst we can examine his misleading claim about hebrews 84 which he shows a quote if jesus was on earth he would not be a priest hence right here he sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise why he does what most so called bible believing people he accuses of doing the same that is taking things out of contextverse one of hebrews 8 is 1now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens the context above is clearly speaking of a jesus who was on earth and ascended into heaven after his alleged resurrectionit has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture here he offers a foundation that paul was not aware of a human jesus but only one in heavenfollowlets see if the filmmaker is being honest hebrews 7 14 for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthoodheh didnt the filmmaker just quote from the writer of hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a human jesus its likely anyways paul didnt write hebrews but i will not go into that here but the film maker asserts paul did and that is the premise of the point given hereit is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas he does but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on once he engages in these tactics in my strong opinion he loses credibility as the religion he picks out and the film is no longer a documentary but a personal opinion and a bias of the film maker nothing more nothing less,0,-1,positive,
this film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of hollywood is worth seeing just because youve got an excellent ensemble cast doesnt mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp think about itthe film featured richard widmark lauren bacall charles boyer gloria graham lillian gish and paul stewart and yet it still was a bad film the basic premise of the film isnt bada private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients also the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife widmark and graham had a lot of promise however the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalowith bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film in fact it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of general hospital subtle this film aint realistic this film aint while most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script but i also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors for example paul stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talentespecially when playing gangsters in film noir movies yet here stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre european accentit just didnt work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and onedimensional also charles boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of america just seemed bizarreoverall this is a rather awful film it is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly isnt very pretty my wife and i disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competentpsin a case of art imitating life oscar levant played one of the patients in real life the brilliant levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions,0,-1,positive,
in following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material the thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time john carpenter fashions out of what mustve been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things or maybe very descriptive who knows bringing forth incredibly wretched brilliant puppetry and animatronics by rob bartin with stan winston also on the team these effects help set the tone against the harsh detached environment carpenter sets up with his characters the film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others its given a full life by carpenters choice of tones and surprises for someone following in the footsteps of howard hawks the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old filmwith the effects people working to full force amid what would likely follow backdraft as containing the most fire per scene it could become overkill but it all fits into the suspense after a while the actors pull along as a fine ensemble unlike the squad in predator these are mostly just regular working guys with the leader coming in the from of kurt russells maccreedy very good role for his style excellent in fact juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of wilford brimley and keith david and it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of whats going on in the film an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory demented transforming form is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone i loved the long silences at times with ennio morricones spooky curious music in the background and that bass line is of merit in itselfit ranks up with being if nothing else delivering what it strives for for its genrecult audience it remains one of carpenters best a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera dialog and timing with the scenes thats not to say the film isnt chock full of violence it is and in fact a couple of times its almost funny but given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a bygone era the creaturesmakeup alongside the steady wellcalculated script was done completely without cgi its disgusting but its real and atmospheric to a t,1,1,positive,
so it starts with a beautiful old house in the country you have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and not surprisingly the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason anywhoo the people laugh joke etc this dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids they get scared they start to feel stuff oh no a girl sees s ghost some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc this girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls yeah yeah blah blah she does but oh no she dies as she does and goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell two people survive and escape the house the script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and elanor the one who dies saving the kids says oh no the acting is wooden the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss i was extremely disappointed when i watched this a very big let down my sister who gets sacred very easily got bored in this film it is appalling,0,0,negative,

i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the goodlooking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket after popping it into my dvd player i reexamined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdbthe filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good then a linereading actor spoke oh dear this actors reading sounded like some pimplefaced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldnt read the jacket english dialog dubbed if theyd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog this film might have been decent i gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasnt going to get killed off but stay as the constant main fixture yes it is that bad the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great so gave the one star but minus 1999999 stars for the rotten dialog i do not recommend this one,0,-1,positive,
viscontis masterpiece i admit that i am unfamiliar with much of his work but i cannot imagine his other work surpassing this fabulous film last night i watched death in venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by all that i saw this captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements the extraordinary shots directed by visconte primarily his love of long languorous shots of people dining swimming walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people the cinematographers brilliant interpretation of viscontis shot selection the acting by the principles without overriding dialog and conveying the scenes complexity through facial features aloneit is true young people watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film a film that could not be made in 2006 a film whose time rests in those brief handful of years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century when artistic license was passed to film directors and moneymen took secondary roles as many of the recent imdb commentators have written this film in their judgment is long boring too little action and pretentious i suppose by the standards of hollywood pap these comments contain merit unfortunately they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those yearsplease if you have not seen death in venice rent a copy and immerse yourself in a film and story from another time you will be rewarded,1,1,positive,
i get the impression that i was watching a different movie to the majority of other people i know who have seen this film its not really that i found the film offensive or anything just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it i really respected paul haggis work on the million dollar baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was it was clear to me that it was desperate to be the racism version of traffic but i dont think traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place the worst feature of thisfilm is the way it shamelessly spoonfeeds its audience does haggisreally think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks do wereally need to see the phone book sitting on farhads dashboard withthe address circled in black texta can we not be left to make someleaps in logic for ourselves i also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so on the nose i have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high because even though people may not speak this way they certainly do think this way that is irrelevant it is the job of a script like this to utilise dialogue in a way that helps add to the characterisations and believability of the in this case highly implausible situations that are set up these characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations but by making it the sole focus of every scene doesnt it become innately racist itself characters walk around spouting their philosophies and conveniently memorised statistics on race relations as though theyre regurgitating extracts from the research essay theyve just written its utterly unconvincing and obvious a film should reveal its meaning gradually not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up i can see that haggis intentions with this film were honorable but dare i suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and therefore overcome its flaws i really hope that writerdirectors will be really careful in future when approaching this mosaic style of narrative it has been done well a number of times but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult and robert altman will not be outdone in that department,0,0,negative,

i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all grossouts not true scaresi dont remember much of the plot and i think thats because there wasnt much of one to remember they didnt even use the hotel to its fullest potentialthe beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula at low tide you can walk almost 14 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracksthe best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and im using that term looslyscenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings,0,1,positive,

regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film that vigilante justice is acceptable is justifiable i was more insulted by mcconaugheys closing statement in a courtroom drama the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury this basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl i for one find this very insulting as for the rest i found the acting reasonable with the exception of sandra bullock who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self doesnt really work in a courtroom drama but whats the point when the films message is as poor as this one it tells you that vigilante justice is fine and accuses you of racism if you disagree,0,0,negative,

it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the 1990s a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the airwaves the best producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television who experienced a major golden age with the dreamteam of steven spielberg tom ruegger and paul dini along with serious and dark series like batman they also revived zany outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and today but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by reinventing the looney tunes for a new generation while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group no matter how old even when the tiny toons were stretched to a featurelength with how i spent my vacation it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series a curse that so often plagues other featurelength adaptations of popular animated showsthe tiny toon gang are young offsprings of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their toon degree summer vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do buster bunny charles adler and babs bunny tress macneille start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to acme acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the mississippi plucky duck joe alaskey joins hamton pig don messick on a crosscountry car trip to the happiest theme park in the world but hamtons family proves to be more difficult than he imagined meanwhile in other stories scattered throughout elmyra duff cree summer tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze fifi le fume kath soucie attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon gail matthius goes to the cinema with a loudmouth fowlmouth rob paulenwhile the premise sounds thin for a featurelength film the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together the best of these is pluckys unfortunate road trip which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well feeling pity for somebody while also laughing at their predicament pluckys annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork elmyras story definitely ranks second just to see how a little almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals the aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the forefront with buster and babs story which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes but also nostalgically since ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to deliverance including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures theme songpart of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of childrens fare that people seem to slap it with an entire segment featuring fowlmouths poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a noteperfect way along with an additional jab at lucasfilms thx logo that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world cinematic plot holes and even warners legal department the fact that todays cartoons are bland and uncreative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come closeafter watching how i spent my vacation for the first time in many years i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to with the ongoing censorship that todays family entertainment receive one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film but also a plea for spielberg ruegger and dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again lord knows that the children of the twentyfirst century is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures this is not a simple cashgrab it is a wonderful film with full of spirit madcap mayhem and hilarity,1,0,positive,

promos on the telly had kindled but now you labeled sarkar your tribute to godfather instead of the word inspired which you had been using all along probably you dont want the two creations to be compared but when the medium is the same then a kaante would be compared to reservoir dogs and a reservoir dogs to a city on firealso when your first and last sequences the heart of any screenplay treatment are all about the establishment and the transfer of power you cant keep the nagares and the corleones apart even if you replace the american mafia moves with maharashtrian political power playbut you got it wrong mr varma you wanted to show amitabh in his 70s avatar as rustled up by the pens of salimjaved you wanted him to lurk around larger than life you wanted him to be his own brando then how could you steal his voice in the name of using silence how could you keep him rooted to his chair in the hunt for interesting camera angles how could you leave him stranded without his voice and stature the two things that have made his b so big coppolas godfather cameraman gordon willis masked brandos eyes throughout the movie because it didnt have the power to match that drawling husky voice or that sudden snap of the fingers but you tried to repeat the malik act from your very own company but bachchan is no ajay devgan his forte doesnt lie in the stagnant stare and the suffocating silence you made the man look like a comatose patient whos reminded from time to time to look at the cue cards and mouth those predictable oneliners for that agneepaths there any given saturdaywhich bachchan fan would go and watch kay kay menon stealing the thunder from under his nose in the scene where sarkar asks vishnu to leave his house which amitabh aficionado would go and watch him focus on achaar and carom in a film that talks about power with a capital p in the promos we cant handle so much in the name of restraint and understatement you dont even allow the camera to rest on him for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him give me the oldschool cameraonlyonbachchan style any given saturdaykudos to you of course for making an actor out of abhishek first in naach and now in sarkar you also allow him to show mallika sherawat that he can run as well as his father even in the short prison sequence you really make the bachchans come out of the text an opportunity shaad missed in bunty aur babli wish the film could have been more a fatherson story rather than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of characters who pop up like the ad windows on the internetyou also let the women more into the script than puzo and coppola did and again you deserve all the brownie points for squeezing them in so effectively pathak is a welcome return as the mother in the middle tanishaa lovable as the lovelorn girl katrina a revelation as abhisheks confused lover and rukhsars silence speaks volumesbut subplots do not a classic remake when your freeflowing camera tries to make every frame look hatke and your loud background score irritates incessantly we keep getting reminded that we are in a factory well maybe not a nino rota score but sarkar certainly deserved better than those govinda govinda chants and uncalledfor flute interludesmr varma some of your factory directors tell me that you are involved with every project from overseeing the shooting schedules to supervising the editing sessions perhaps in the middle of all the various storyboards the bhiku matre scream is being muted by the subhash nagare silence perhaps you need to bring the shutters down on the factory and work on a single homemade product otherwise your products would remain products to use and throw not treasure and movie buffs like me for whom there are no hits and flops only good cinema would rather choose a film without factory finish any given saturday,0,-1,positive,
saw it at the philadelphia gay and lesbian film festwhat can i say against my better judgment i liked it but it seemed to me that that acting was a littleweak mostly i noticed this from the family of the teen boy i mean the script wasnt stellar to begin with but the actors didnt make me believe the relationshipsthe plot is also predictablenonethelss i liked it the characters are likable and the plot is not challenging or upsetting its sweet the characters care about each other and i dont count it as fifty minutes illspent but i dont recommend it,0,-1,neutral,
i first saw the knowledge during a thames television marathon on one of the local independent stations in los angeles back when it was new i enjoyed it very much along with danger uxbthat a movie i saw once over twenty year ago should stick so well in my memory is a testament to its originality and the quality of the performances by the casti looked for a dvd copy here in the usa and found none i finally gambled and bought a uk dvd off ebay and was delighted to find that it has no region code so those of us that would like to see this little gem can get a copy,1,-1,positive,
visually interesting but falls flat in the originality department this tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle jude law has the charisma of burnt toast but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen on the big screen in fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film and had me thinking about work bills my dogs etc there are many moments that scream bluescreen paltrow is as wooden as they get this could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp my only complaint on the technique is that black white film sorry computer would of helped because it looks like turner colorized black and white just a big dull clich mess i would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again,0,0,negative,
sometimes a film comes along that is unique the nostril picker is one such film the nostril picker is like no other film i have ever seen unfortunately for the nostril picker myself its unique for different reasons than what the filmmakers had originally intended read on all shall hopefully become clear the nostril picker as its commonly know although it was apparently filmed under the title the changer starts with some extremely dull shots of an american town somewhere streets factorys that sort of thing as the opening credits play when the nostril picker begins proper we the viewer that is are introduced to a real loser named joe bukowski carl zschering who is in his 40s he lives on his own in a crappy little apartment where he watches tv eats beef flavoured dog food listens to old vinyl records as he dances with a blow up rubber sex doll joe likes teenage girls he has various porn magazines but enjoys the real thing even more however being an ugly git joe cant tempt any young ladies to go out with him or do anything else with him for that matter one fateful day an old homeless vietnam vet horace grimm sees the agony pain that joe has to go through actually he sees joe being spoken to by the cops for hassling a teenage girl decides to help him out he tells joe about an incantation that he learned from the gooks in vietnam that will transform joes appearance into whatever he likes a process he calls morphosynthesis but at the same time he warns joe that it makes you crazy if you do it too much that night joe decides to give it a try in a public place on a podium for some reason joe says a few words does an extremely silly dance starts yodelling joe finishes off by whistling london bridge is falling down listen yeah i aint making this up either at first joe is visibly disappointed when nothing significant happens to console himself joe tries to buy a porn mag but is shocked when the clerk kevin devoy refuses to sell it to an underage girl joe the bright spark that he is realises what has happened talks hisher way out of it by claiming hisher dad had sent himher to buy it joe who now calls his alterego josephine ann flood senses the possibilities heads straight for the local high school joe befriends four teenage girls jennifer armstrong laura cummings crisi stroud gail didia tracy harper heidi m gregg brenda kearn aimee molinaro while under his disguise oh joe manages to become a pupil at the school simply by asking the sports teacher miss van dyke vicki hollis at first joe seems harmless enough he just likes to hang around the girls toilets stuff like that but things soon change as joe brutally murders brenda jennifers dad vince armstrong edward tanner is a detective so along with his partner ed simpson clyde surrell walt spencer bruce alden the pathologist is determined to catch the sicko responsible for killing his daughters friends but will they succeed before joe strikes again the imdb listing for the nostril picker is wrong i watched it mere hours ago it clearly states that its directed by mark nowicki who was also a coproducer definitely not patrick j matthews who was credited as a coproducer the cinematographer not that it makes much difference id have though that nowicki would have been more than happy for matthews to take the credit for making this piece of crap no one involved in the making of the nostril picker should be allowed to go anywhere near a camera again ever the nostril picker is easily one of the worst films ive ever seen thats saying something its absolutely terrible in every possible way imaginable the script by steven hodge is atrocious theres no narrative structure excitement tension drama character development the things that do happen are so mind numbingly dumb its untrue the plot devices chain of events in the nostril picker are totally incomprehensible the scene where joe finds out the prostitute steven andrews he hired is in fact a man joe starts to chase him around his apartment with two squirting dildos is simply jaw dropping stuff the subsequent scene when the transvestite reports the incident to the police is hilariously written had me psychically laughing at the dialogue i hated the ending as well not only was it predictable but it leaves the door open for a sequel i psychically shudder at the mere thought on a technical level the nostril picker is awful point hope photography bland inappropriate music forgettable locations poorly edited brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her blood splashes on the tv screen that was clearly in the opposite room some of the worst acting ive sat through very unimpressive special effects which consist of a few cut off rubber fingers a slit throat a quick scene where joe eats some flesh it comes as no surprise that the cast crew who worked on the nostril picker have virtually no imdb credits for anything before or after even at 76 odd minutes the nostril picker is far to long really boring to sit through i could go on on all day long about how bad the nostril picker is i really could one thing i cant quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers the nostril picker is indeed a unique film unique in its awfulness incompetence in the the case of the nostril picker i hope it remains unique too having said that its still not the worst film ive ever seen but it comes close thats for sure definitely one to avoid,0,0,negative,
ive given kh jik a low score not because it was a bad movie but because it doesnt do anything worth praisingive not seen any of hsiaohsien hous work before but for the uninitiated me included kh jik is advertised as a homage to yasujiro ozu a japanese director whose last film was way way in 1962 the film is an extremely sparse workcontaining very little dialogue story music or emotionyo hitoto plays yoko a jobless wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely investigating a taiwanese composer she likes tadanobu asano plays her friend who works in a cd shop and occasionally indulges his otaku interest in trains and thats about all itwe watch as yoko drinks coffee alonewalks aroundwaits for a traincatches a trainfalls asleep on the train the kind of mundane reality anybody in japan can see on a daily basis hou captures these ordinary moments of these characters life but without any meaning to these vignettes its an entirely pointless film to make or watch,0,0,negative,
this film has absolutely no redeeming features its not even worthy of being in the so bad its good category its simply bad badly acted badly shot badly written badly directed terrible sound recording and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur quite how this got a release is beyond meoh and could someone please tell the lead actress that if youre playing mad that does not mean that you should constantly fiddle with your hair in a film that was generally irritating this was probably one of the most irritating things of allon the plus side i think this is the only film ever to feature a nazi carjacker,0,0,negative,
i dont really know when it was that tv stations began preferring to have handsome men as their reporters regardless of the mens iqs but it was clearly a problem by the time that broadcast news came out and the movie does a really good job looking at it portraying a love triangle between pretty boy airhead reporter tom grunick william hurt intelligent but nervous reporter aaron altman albert brooks and producer jane craig holly hunter the movie pulls no punches probably the best line in the movie is when tom says something like i dont really understand any of what im reporting and in the era of fox news and such things a movie like this becomes even more importantall in all definitely a movie that i recommend also starring robert prosky lois chiles joan cusack and jack nicholson in a supporting role as the anchorman,1,-1,positive,
i gave this movie a 10 simply out of my sick obsession with ingrid bergman lol i really think she was the best actress to ever grace this earth with her talent and all of her movies are absolutely wonderful even when they are awful because she is in them if it hadnt been her and vivien leigh as it had originally been desired i hear i would have given it a 90 simply because i love viv but probably not as much as i love ingrid and any other actress would have made it maybe a 6 its a good story two wild people falling in love in a society where it bad to be bad reminds me a little of gwtw except laced with a more highbrow attitude gary cooper is very handsome as usual and of course his voice never changes the entire film but hey ingrid makes him seem so amazing and dashing and 20 times hotter than he probably should be,1,-1,positive,

taylor deemer mrs drake english 10 pib b4 31 march 2010 a shot in the darkit is difficult to make it through the movie heart of darkness because it is incredibly unexciting the book that this movie is based off of has little action to begin with so the thought of turning it into a movie seems like a totally offhanded idea anyways basically guaranteeing a fail most of the book is of the mental travel of a young seaman named marlow on a job through the many darknesses of the congo and people as a whole i feel like the screenwriter failed massively at capturing the essence of marlows travels it totally missed the biggest issue of light versus dark that is the major point in the book and when that doesnt translate to the movie all thats left is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony this being the case the question is posed why would anyone make this into a movie an even better question could then be asked who would want to watch it it is utterly a chore to watch had it not contributed to a grade in my english class i would have never even considered watching the movie i would never recommend this movie to anyone heart of darkness is stripped of all its insight and meaning when its taken from the pages of the book the novella is torture to read until the last twenty pages or so but the afterthought is that it is a pretty decent book the movie is like a shot in the dark with no chance in the world of hitting its target how can a book thats all about the mental processes and realizations of darkness be portrayed in a physical visual sense i feel like its impossible to accurately show thoughts also i feel like the time difference between the book and the movie creates major points that dont seem to add up at all the novella heart of darkness was published in 1902 while the movie version of heart of darkness is from 1993 the 91 years between the two may be a reason behind the seemingly different terrains the novella seems to have much harsher conditions and the movie does not portray the prehistoric feel of the congo the congo in the movie just seems like another place not the dark inhuman place that the book paints this setting of i feel like this removes another major element that really contributes to the novellawith two of the biggest aspects of the storyline missing in the movie the little bit of decency that is in the book heart of darkness is gone when the controversy of light versus dark is the biggest theme not including it in the movie makes it seem like the entire movie will be incredibly pointlessand it is its dull unexciting and a major waste of time theres no reason to watch it the book is stripped of any significance it has if its necessary for some reason read the book avoid the movie at all costs cast and credits marlow tim roth kurtz john malkovich the russianmorten faldaas the intended phoebe nichollsdirected by nicolas roeg written by benedict fitzgerald based on the novella by joseph conrad running time 100 minutes rated pg 13 some sexuality and language,0,-1,neutral,
mute witness is a modest yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves the film written and directed entirely by anthony waller is a tense actionpacked thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences no pointless mumbojumbo or endless plottwists just straight to the point mystery mute witness handles about the vicious topic of snuffmovies and is effectively set in russia spoilers since the production costs are cheaper there a us film crew temporarily moves to russia for shooting a horror film an old hangar is used as film location the female makeup artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuffmovie shes caught and tries to escape but since shes a mute she cant cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly the girls life is in real danger now since theres a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they dont want the witnesses to be alive end spoilers mute witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end regarding the similar topic id say its definitely better than the more famous 8 mm directed by joel schumacher and starring nicolas cage the acting in mute witness isnt great but the leading actress whos russian herself looks really cute sir alec guinness makes a special appearance too and a very cool one i may say surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares,1,1,positive,
there is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst i have seen in some time as f scott fitzgerald gregory peck and sheilah graham deborah kerr are lounging on the beach suddenly things become tense and sheilah begins to cryat which point she tells her lover about her sordid past this dramatic scene becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic i couldnt help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all wasas dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo no one experiences moments like thisno one now how much of the rest of the film is true i cannot say but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an 8 rolexand leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correctthe film is a lot of bunk however i am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didnt seem to clear this up either just who were f scott fitzgerald and sheilah graham and what was their relationship really like what i do know about fitzgerald however does seem different from what i saw in the film was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film well considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and drank like a fish id assume he wasnt was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film perhaps but if he was this bad and yet ms graham stayed with him then this makes her out to be a complete dummyand not someone youd like to see featured in a film and if he wasnt then the film does a poor disservice to his memory either way it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experiencethe sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people in a dark and salacious way some might find this all very entertaining but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way unpleasant but with glossy production values especially the music which was lovely but way over the top it begs the question why did they even choose to make this in the first place the bottom lineits a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your timeeven if like me you are big gregory peck fan,0,0,positive,

my first question after seeing this film was why is the title liam if the intent was to tell a story from the boys perspective it was not carried out well of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boys scenes but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view having a main character unable to speak obviously suggesting the mute powerless position of a child makes it difficult to give that character much depthmelodrama is defined as dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters exaggerated emotions and language simplistic morality and conflict liam fits this definition to a t the viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone catholic church in the stern school marm and the wellfed priest squeezing money from parishioners a stereotype which is becoming very tiresome whats morethe jewish characters are money lenders and factory ownersmuch of the film was predictablewho didnt think that wed see theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her no daughter of mine will scrub another womans toilet im a fan of british realism if its done well in my opinion liam is not,0,-1,neutral,
i first saw death in venice 1971 about 15 years ago found it profoundly moving and often thought about it watching it again few days ago i realized that it is close to the top of the great works of cinema with hardly any dialog it captivates a viewer with the beautiful cinematography the fine acting and above all the mahlers music without which the movie simply could not existdeath in venice is a stunning luchino viscontis adaptation of the thomas mann novella about a famous composer in the novella he was a writer but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably gustav von aschenbach loosely based on gustav mahler who travels to venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures his search for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty ashenbach dirk bogard follows the boy everywhere never trying to approach him the boy tadzio belonged to very rare creatures that own an enigmatic and inconceivable power which captivates you enchants you conquers you and makes you its prisoner ashenbach became one of the prisoners of tadzio spellbinding charms he became addicted to him he fell in love with him was it bless or curse for him i think both he died from unreachable impossible yet beautiful love which object was perfection itself the last image ashenbachs eyes captured was that of the boys silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sun light nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and to take it with you to the grave is the death one can only dream about if he could ashenbach probably wouldve said i was able to witness one of the faces of perfection i could not bear it but i was chosen to learn that it exists here in this world and i can die in peace now because it did happen to me unforgettable music gustav mahlers haunting adagietto of his fifth symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie it reflects every emotion of a main character it sobs it longs it begs for hope and it summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to encounter beauty you are condemned to die i may come up with hundreds movies that use classical music to perfection but nothing will ever compare to death in venice i dare say that mahlers music is its main character it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen it sounded triumphantly when ashenbach returned back to venice to what he thought would be his happiness but turned to be his death it sounded gloomy when he first entered venice from the sea you can hear so many different feelings in it tenderness and adoration confusion and selfloathing worship and melancholy but always love that gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts literally the movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the aging composerwriterartist we are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty as much as achenbach was by the boys mysterious charm,1,1,positive,

i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie ive never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels they just dont make movies like this anymoreafter recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film hearts of darknessa filmmakers journey into madness im even more amazed that this film even got finished yet alone turn out so greatthe fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the phillipines is the films greatest asset you actually feel like your in vietnamall of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being robert duvall i love the smell of napalm in the morning martin sheen and the great marlon brandoa lot of people complain that the film gets too murky weird and cerebral near the end well remeber what coppolla said about this movie this film is not about vietnam it is vietnam what he means is that this film is about madness and not the warthis movie is based on the short story heart of darkness by joseph conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinionthis is perfect challenging film that is dark violent humorous at times and well done in every single possible waya true classicrating10,1,1,positive,

ive seen enough of both little richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor leon pigeonholed into these 50s60s musical bio pics to know that leon was not the right actor for this role leon was so right as david ruffin in the temptations but fails utterly to capture the essence of little richard in this film actor miguel nez who played little richard in why do fools fall in love was a much more suitable choice having pulled off the musicians powerful but effeminate persona if the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well and this is what has happened here glossed over or missed entirely are lrs forays into homosexuality and voyeurism what the temptations did so well in capturing the rise of the group warts and all this film misses by a wide markwhat is going on with director robert townsend who started off so well with the hollywood shuffle hes a talented funny guy but hasnt delivered anything near that first effort,0,0,positive,
i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itor if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty snchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respectthis is a show that has little taste or class its not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed outnow these guys need to see a psychologist specially the paco character,1,-1,positive,
i first didnt want to watch this film for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected filmbut as i recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinit which was beautifully directed and written by laurent tirard screenwriter of prtemoi ta main i changed my mind and decided to try it thinking that prtemoi ta main would be as good as mensonges and it is absolutely not the script is not bad but it is not as well directed as mensonges the actors not as generous especially charlotte as boring as she usually is as edouard baer or clovis cornillac and too be honest i still dont understand how such crap can have such a success even with such a casting anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots but it is not as good as tirards mensonges though its also written by him easy unsurprising and lazy work totally overestimated,0,0,negative,
in my opinion this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it had been short 10 years earlier i doubt it would benefit from modern technologies but it would have looked much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70the artists and animated did a great job in my opinion this movie can boast the best background art and one of the best character design animation are extremely smooth and realistic for the duration of the movie you believe in the world you see so everyone did a great job it can also boast one of the sexiest female animated characters if not the sexiest that beets typical anime girls with easeunfortunately there are a couple of bad thins about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the moment first the plot and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure movies and is really oldfashioned by modern standards second due to the duration time it would benefit a lot from extra 20 minutes of dialogs finally the setting is not so popular at the momentconclusion a great alternative to another short story about conan the barbarian but not to a novel,1,-1,positive,
this miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film they should have let it remain that waywhat a colossal bomb douglas fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here cesar romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and bette grable sings with a chorus what ill do to that hungarianthe ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror fairbanks now lets fast forward to 300 years later where grable just married to the count romero faces a similar situation when on her wedding night there is an invasion by hungarian soldiersromero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives he disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases fairbanks the ending is worse than the entire wretched film when grable meets fairbanks to tell him the good newsan enraged romero has annulled the marriagethis poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948 as harry davenport a veteran supporting player who is in it died in 1949 this must have been his last film what a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished careerwalter abel costars but he can do little with such poor writing the costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age i cant fathom what fairbanks was wearing,0,0,negative,
i waited almost 25 years to see this movie thinking it might be an underrated work from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been it starred one of the best film villains of all time was based on a beloved series of childrens books and was a disney studios production what could possibly be wrong with it as it turns outs almost everythingwell not everything vincent price as rattigan and henry mancinis swanky score are the movies two saving graces price is wickedly enjoyable and mancini more professional than the material deserves they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity meanwhile the rest of the movie while filled with inappropriately adult situations still suffers from a completely dull script blandly generic voice work terrible songs and lazy animation that wouldnt have been out of place on any of disneys mid1980s saturday morning tv showsthis was a complete disappointment to me its amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of nimh costing a fraction of this an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than gmd has in its endless running timethe extra star that keeps this from being awful goes to price and mancini,0,0,positive,
trey parker and matt stone the creators of south park finally get out of their grueling schedule to talk to the cameras while sipping champagne in their hot tub at first when watching this i did not sense as much sarcasm as there was in this i knew they were joking when they would complain about different actors on the show and when trey said he wasnt going to give his mother any of his money but there is so much sarcasm throughout that this documentary is more of a mockumentary full of inside jokesthis documentary shows everything about south park up until the second season anyways it shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording it has interviews many of which are fake interviews but some amongst all the fabrications give insight into the show clips from both of trey parkers spirit of christmas shorts are shown as are many good clips from the show if you were a south park fan then this should have quenched your thirst for show knowledge back in late 1998 when this was made now obviously the show has changed but this is still interestingwhat we have here is an amusing documentary where trey parker especially and matt stone come off as arrogant jerks and thats exactly what they wanted to come off as they may be this way in real life but here it was a joke a 51 minute long insightful jokemy rating out of 51 mins not rated contains language and sexual content,1,-1,neutral,

this film is so incredibly bad that i almost felt sick watching it up until this point the other installments had at least one good thing about it part 1 was suspenseful and gory part 2 was off beat and entertaining part 3 was interesting with great effects part 4 had great music good special effects and a new entertaining freddy krueger part 5 is more boring than anything ive ever seen before alice a much prettier blond from part 4 is back with her boyfriend dan at parts this supposed elm street installment turns into a daytime soap the newer characters seem harsh and even that sweet alice has a chip on her shoulder freddy seems to be completely out of this one he looks tired and doesnt seem to be as gruesome his oneliners seem out of place and different where as in part 4 they could be pretty funny leslie bohems story never gets off the ground and stephen hopkins direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good the whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic its also confusing and pretty stupid avoid part 5 at all costs,0,0,positive,

not knowing a great deal about the truth and reconciliation commission i can only look at this as a piece of entertainment i started watching it too late in the evening recorded from bbc2 earlier this year but once id started i had to watch to the endthe downside is that its effectively a courtroom drama never my favourite genre but its stunningly photographed largely in supersaturated ochres and well acted like a good novel i couldnt put it down all the way through i wished i was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice what happened to its release in theatres im an admirer of chiwetel ejiofor since i saw him in dirty pretty things and hilary swank looks terrific in this very female and sexy for a change possibly out of place but she adds to the visual attractiveness of the filmthis picture deserves a wider audience than it seems to be getting,1,1,positive,
i think the best way for me to review this title is to split it into its pros and conspros they turn into wolves rather than plasticcartoony monsters the chase of the wolves through the forest cash machine by hardfi being playedcons some parts of the script makes you cringe for example the terrible part where the woman escapes the games of the fortunate five boys and theres about half an hour of dear cousin and a round robin of yes see we know gabriels law the diving transformation is ridiculous the obvious and ridiculous ending aiden being told thousands of times to leave and then goes if you cared about me you would have left me the obvious characters the unnecessary parcour the completely unnecessary slashing of the arm by aiden cringey speeches by gabrielyou see what i meani adore werewolf films and i tried watching this a few times to see if id like it better but it just made it worse i think ill just read the book and see how i get ondont bother with this unless you have a 12 year old brother or sister into spooky things anyone over that age may suffer and want their hour and a half back,0,0,positive,

after the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident her young understudy betty is brought to the forefront thats very lucky for her with one problem she has an admirer that has decided he will kill all her friends and make her watch what is his connection to the opera and what is his fascination with betty i love dario argento with every part of my body and im not an orthodox fan i think many people particularly critics praise his earlier work suspiria and deep red but really frown on later films such as sleepless which i liked my favorite phenomena is usually vastly underrated opera tends to fall somewhere in between some consider it one of his last great films others see it as part of his socalled decline i loved itthe picture is crisp the music is great unlike other critics i love the metal soundtrack the female lead is someone i can feel for not unlike jennifer connelly from phenomena and the imagery wonderful great cinematography and some amazing kill scenes the concept of taping needles to a persons eyes so they cannot blink brilliant my assistant tina thinks this looked fake but even if it does the idea is more than enough to pay off and some great effects like a knife blade coming up inside a mans mouth awesomejim harper calls the film stunning and calls attention to the innovative cinematography wellconstructed shots and exceptionally violent murders i agree with this completely one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story mike mayo likewise calls it visually fascinating eyecandy and lauds the crisp editing and flowing camerawork its really a wonder that this is not one of argentos more highlypraised worksargento returned to the opera with phantom of the opera which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter asia and julian sands even more interesting this same year offered the release of michele soavis stagefright which like opera has a killer loose inside a theater killing off the people involved with the presentation both are great films with soavis more on the slasher side soavi actually served as second unit director on opera you can make your own conclusions my only complaint with this film is the length and pacing while it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious they are not as frequent as they should be the first one takes over a half hour and then we get down times between them the lead actress should be in constant terror but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything is normal again not cool dario we need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high,1,1,positive,

i sat through both parts of che last night back to back with a brief bathroom break and i cant recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly id had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because i have a real thing about directors producers and editors who keep putting over blown over long quasi epics in front of us and i feel that on the whole 2 to 25 hours is about right for a movie so 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and i was very dubious about the whole enterprise but i will say upfront that this is a beautifully i might say lovingly made movie and im really glad i saw it director steven soderbergh is to be congratulated on the clarity of his vision the battle scenes zing as if you were dodging the bullets yourselfif there is a person on the planet who doesnt know ernesto che guevara was the argentinian doctor who helped fidel castro overthrow fulgencio batista via the 1959 cuban revolution when i was a kid in the 1960s ches image was everywhere on bedroom wall posters on t shirts on magazine covers ches image has to be one of the most over exploited ever if the famous images are to be relied on then che was a very good looking guy the epitome of revolutionary romanticism had he been butt ugly i have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination of course dying young helpsmovies have been made about che before notably the excellent motorcycle diaries of 2004 which starred the unbearably cute gael garcia bernal as young che touring south america and seeing the endemic poverty which formed his marxist politics but i dont think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from beginning to end and this twoparter is an ambitious project i hope it pays off for soderbergh but i can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been uppermost in his mindthe first movie the agentine shows che meeting castro in mexico and follows their journey to cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to new york in 1964 to address the un cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but arent the second film guerilla picks up again in 1966 when che arrives in bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement the second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest as far as i can see it was shot mostly in spain but i can still believe it must have been quite grueling to film benicio del toro is excellent as che a part he seems born to playpersonally i felt that the argentine ie part one was much easier to watch and more entertaining in the strictly movie sense because it is upbeat they are winning the revolution will succeed che is in his element leading a disparate band of peasants workers and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause the second part is much harder to watch because of the inevitability of his defeat in much the same way that the recent valkyrie while being a good movie was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure so i felt the same about part two of che guerilla we know at the outset that he dies we know he fails it is frustrating because the way the story is told it is obvious fairly early on that the fomentation of revolution in bolivia is doomed che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the indigenous peoples in the way that he did with the cubans he doggedly persists which is frustrating to watch because i felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other perhaps more successful enterprises the movie does not romanticise him too much he kills people he executes he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on he leaves a wife alone to bring up five fatherless childrenbut overall an excellent exercise in classic movie making one note as i watched the us trained bolivian soldiers move in en masse to pick off che and his small band of warriors one by one it reminded me of the finale to butch cassidy i almost turned to my husband and said so but hesitated thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place as we left the theatre he turned to me and said didnt you think the end was like butch cassidy,1,1,positive,

although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowherethe film is about erroll babbage gere who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire his office thrusts upon him his replacement allison lowry claire danes stardust who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job and that job aint very fun he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his flock of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement but erroll is good at his job even if his methods arent he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants pasts it is this good justification that challenges the audience on some level letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how outoftouch hes become by being too close to his jobwhen a teenage girl goes missing in errolls area he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock but how could he know is erroll that good at his job allison challenges him and erroll pushes back their battles become as fierce as errolls need to find this missing girlalthough the setup for the story was okay it didnt have any umpf i will give credit to richard gere however who plays the erroll character very well battling retirement worried about everyone whos near his flock disgusted with those hes responsible for overseeing disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does quite a change in character portrayal for gere but beyond him theres not much else some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughableill be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films but that suspension has limits the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge nono or trampling through a crime scene or moving evidence it went beyond and hurt the film to no endthe other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes character allison shes almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and were never privy to what her intension might be will she stay or leave will she end up like erroll if she does stay this isnt a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up,0,0,negative,

this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it its more of a torture flick and it doesnt make sense to me there is a few scenes with disappearing bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she completely disappears then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i dont think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didnt kill him the at the end she sets the killers truck on fire that but hes not in it he is standing behind her then it cuts to the rest stop has been completely remodeled and some people are at the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie save yourself some money and skip this movie,0,-1,neutral,

subconscious cruelty has to be one of the most disturbing films ive ever seen salo and cannibal holocaust didnt bother me that much but theres a strange psychological element to subconscious cruelty this film invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos surrealist visuals and one of the most unsettling film scores and sound designs repulsive at times yes but its visual flair can be compared to avant gard directors such as alejandro jodorowsky dario argento dusan makavejev and david lynch take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and throw in the graphic violence of a film by luico fulci and you might be able to guess what youre in for the film is divided into 4 parts the first part the ovarian eye is real short a narrator tells us about the the parts of the brain and its functions then a nude woman gets her stomach cut open and an eyeball is pulled out the second part human larvae is kind of like the film eraserhead but with incest it deals with a mans sexual obsession with his pregnant sister wheres frued when you need him the third part is my absolute favorite it reminds me of begotten and james broughtons 1972 short film dreamwood in this segment people have sex with the earth men hump bloody holes in the ground girls masturbate with tree branches the branches bleed when broken watch in horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife sticking out of a womans vagina these people really know how to get in touch with naturethe last part of the film is the most disturbing and at times it borders on hardcore pornography this part of the film made me think of jodorowskys the holy mountain sweet movie and cannibal holocaust ive never been more disturbed in my life by what i witnessed a business man gets his privates pulled apart by fishhooks yuck and ouch two women urinate on a christ figure and proceed to cannibalistically eat him like communion bread and sodomize him with a tree branch poor guy the last part was so extreme that if i ever watch the film again ill have close my eyes or slightly fast forward karim hussien and mitch davis are obviously very talented to think they did this project in there early 20s hussein went on to direct the tarkovsky influenced ascension 2002 which is a much better film and he cowrite the screenplay for nacho cerdas after dark horror masterpiece the abandoned subconscious cruelty is a fascinating and unsettling journey with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds well sort of,1,0,negative,

than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie what was the motive the details of the murders were used but never explained i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere which is great but the story is definitely lacking there is no thread to follow i guess if that was done properly the movie wouldve lasted a bit longer but it wouldve been worth it at least for mecasting is very good i loved wilson as the vulnerable vickynot much more to say really but i really wish theyve concentrated a bit more on the less obvious,0,1,positive,
ok so my summary line is a cheap trick but the movie is full of them and it gets absurdly praised soi caught this one on tv uncut as tv here shows all movies thats for you americans who might say i didnt like it because i saw a cut tv version fortunately thats only an us thing and had no idea about what it was i switched on caught the last minutes of a show and the movie began within a minute i was begging it was a comedy given the particularly ridiculous clichd beginning yes its a bad moviewithinthemovie i know but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested i dont even know why i didnt switch channels and yes in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy albeit an unintentional onemarina zudina is pretty enough but gosh what a dreadful performance while casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough she doesnt talk so bye bye language barrier yet sorry marina baby playing mute doesnt mean impersonating harpo marx her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments just look at her when she draws an x in the air while stalked by the killer he wants to kill you its no time to play zorro we get plenty of running upstairs stuff passing for tension as in the worst slashers and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other ugh will hollywood ever learn yet the bestworst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and well i have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub but im sure you cant see the blue cartoon rays in real life do you and how about immediately trusting a meanlooking guy because he says hes a cop and not asking him to show you his credentials ok so he turns out to be a real cop but still not asking for the badge makes no sense plotwise we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop screen writing 101 and how about the big twist dont tell me you didnt see that coming from 200 miles awayi feel sorry for poor old alec guinness and his useless stock footage cameo now i think about this whats the point in giving him a mystery guest star credit in the end titles the movies over theres no mystery anymore and everybody and their brother have identified guinness even nonmovie buffs will recognize the old guy from star wars yet better off this way so we can pretend its not the late great actorpeople keep comparing this to of all people hitchcock i suppose it has to be john hitchcock the milkman as the late sir alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this let alone making it and this gets a 6810 its bottom 100 material but then were talking a rating system that allows the lord of the rings the return of the king to appear as the third best movie ever made check top 100 so210,0,0,positive,

yes there are great performances here unfortunately they happen in the context of a movie that doesnt seem to have a clue what its doing during the first 4560 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance suddenly about an hour in the characters who until this point had always spoken to each other suddenly start singing to each other to further confuse things a little further in out of nowhere they actually do about 15 minutes of sungthrough dialog then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section on top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used is the composers clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed while the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s motown sound the rest of the film is just bad broadway show music then theres the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad jackson family imitation and eddie murphy morphing from little richard to james brown to lionel richie when he started channeling stevie wonder i couldnt help laughing out loud this was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time i have on earth and resent that i wasted two hours of it watching this film,0,-1,positive,

this film is really only bill mahers interpretation of religion there are several funny moments and some interesting points but dont go into this expecting an evenhanded discussion of religion this is what i consider to be the worst kind of documentary everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director rather than letting you make your own decisionediting its very chopped up interspliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point the interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing the only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what bill maher wants them to say once someone deviates from the gospel according to maher they get editedinterviewees they are meant to represent the absolute most extremist religions from the tv evangelical to the ultimate jewish stereotype to a truck stop chapel seriously a truck stop chapel hes picked the worst moneygrabbers the heavy extremists and those who dont have the budget to say no to pick on and when he does get a good person to interview he edits the hell out of themstereotyping all religions are portrayed as stereotypes especially hard hit are the muslims during the muslim segment he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers all muslims are portrayed as guntoting extremists through the editing and none of the people interviewed is edited fairlyending the message at the end is incredibly heavyhanded and while it is an interesting idea its not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists bill maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground this literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world he also states that everyone involved in religion is stupidwith the faults to the film it has some good points and the humor while very unfair is actually funny but know going in it is a very onesided view bill mahers view of religion hes not discovering anything hes telling you what he thinks410 some good moments but heavyhanded with an extremely irresponsible documentary style,0,0,negative,

this movie is not great but it is a good and enjoyable one it feels like an indie film made out of a play script morgan freeman basically plays himself although the director swears the script was not written for him and there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasnt committed to yet i mean he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it i found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste but refreshing nonetheless this is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go a bit too much emphasis on appearance if you ask mebottom line a nice little film made in two weeks with basically two actors and a few extras dialogue driven makes morgan freeman look good,1,1,positive,

there is an interesting discussion in this movie is being a moral person good enough or do you need something morethe movie preaches that without the guidance of god being a morally good person is not enough there is a line early in the movie you and i can look at a person who is morally good but both know he is going to go to hellwhile i am not a christian the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating but not in the way the movie intended i left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good is enough the arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance fanaticism can be a powerful thing especially when inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated as george carlins character in dogma said hook em while theyre youngthe basic premise is a very interesting one also a bible scholar from the 1890s is attempting to publish a book that says that morality without god is ok as long as the morality is meaningful do you only tell a child not to steal or do you tell him not to steal because god tells you not to not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because well how would he feel if it was his marbles that were stolenthe author carlisle wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book to spread the world however it needs unanimous consent and one of the scholars opposes it he brings up in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for moralitys sake vs gods words argument to prove his point he produces a time machine put in the movie solely to make the plot work which im fine with and sends carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without god will lead usas should be obvious he has his opinion and is changed by what he sees and has reversed himself by the time of his return for he does return thats not really a spoiler this is a bible movie after allas for the movie as a movie itself its pretty slow and pretty poorly acted something that was not needed in this movie is that it produces two bad guys who want to try to figure out who carlisle is even tho he hasnt hurt anyone committed a crime or anything whats wrong with the movie just showing carlisles opinion showing his view of this sinful world and returning him with a new viewpoint also there a few points in the movie which affirm to me that im happy im not a christian or at least someone who says its god or nothing three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me first when the two bad guys corner carlisle right before he jumps carlisle does his only truly despicable act he fakes like his timejump is the coming of jesus and makes it so the bad guys who are also christians btw oddly enough think they just missed the rapture secondly after carlisle returns he finds a boy in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing but not mentioning god kid kept the marbles and ran away and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because god commands it like the carlin quote above scaring kids into religion is a fauxpas in my bookand lastly the epilogue another scare tactic carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go and he says he doesnt know the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future starts at 2100 and it fails he keeps decrementing the years by 10 and trying again and by the fadeout hes at like 2030 or so throughout the movie carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of god scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years you would think in these enlightened times the church would have enlightened as wellim glad i saw this movie while i was fairly certain before that being morally good was enough now i know it for a fact worth watching if you are not a christian to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folks in this movie,0,0,negative,

uta hagens respect for acting is the standard textbook in many college theater courses in the book hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor the presentational approach and the representational approach in the presentational approach the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible by introducing emotional elements from the actors own life in the representational approach the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control of movement and soundthe representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was made british theater has a long history of this style of acting and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the representational schooltime has not been kind to this school of acting or to this movie nearly every working actor today uses a presentational approach to the modern eye oliviers highly enunciated stylized delivery is stodgy stiff and stilted instead of creating an internally conflicted hamlet olivier made a declaiming selfimportant bullhorn out of the melancholy dane an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters but is far too starchy to carry off a modern hamletand so the movie creaks along ungainfully today oliviers tendency to enunciate makes some of hamlets lines unintentionally funny instead you must acquire and beget a tempurrance that may give it smoothness instead of crying at meeting his fathers ghost as any proper actor could bright fill lights in oliviers pupils give us that impressioneileen herlie is the only other actor of note in this hamlet putting in a good essay at the queen despite the painfully obvious age differences he was 41 she was 26 the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done given oliviers tendency to want to keep the camera on him at all times sixty years later you feel the insecurity of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable flawed hamlet and instead elected to portray a sort of elizabethan bullhorn final analysis i would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing termagant it outherods herod pray you avoid it,0,-1,neutral,

the untold origin of the lone ranger it shows who he was and how and why he became the rangerlegendary bomb the idea was not a bad onereinvent and introduce the lone ranger for 1980s audiences right off the bat though there were problems the studio ordered clayton moore the original ranger to stop appearing anywhere as the lone ranger it led to a nasty little battle that made headlines i know of people who refused to see the film because of how moore was treated also they hired the awesomely untalented klinton spilsbury to play the ranger spilsbury was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and just couldnt act in fact his whole vocal performance was redubbed by another actor also his off screen antics public drunkenness and beating people up didnt help matters acting aside the script is dull and slow also the ranger himself doesnt show up until an hour in there were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a pg however i dont think it was that badthere are a few very few things done right herethe photography was truly beautiful michael horse was excellent as tonto christopher lloyd is lots of fun as the villain and when the lone ranger finally shows up with the william tell overture booming from the soundtrack its really rousing but all in all this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the lone ranger its easy to see why this bombed a 4mostly for the photography,0,0,positive,

this film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe while it is fairly accurate in its description of the events leading up to and the subsequent investigation regarding the first attempt to destroy the world trade center in 1993 seen now post 911 it is almost unbearableit would be a mistake to call this film prophetic but it certainly makes the common playground wisdom of fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me come aliveour government learned nothing from the 1993 attempt on the world trade center and subsequent readings of the 911 report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeatedsome people have criticized the first and fourth amendments of the us constitution as being partly responsible for the islamic terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans but that is wrong headed in every possible waysurely the people making this argument are not supporting a ban on free speech a free press or freedom of religion i certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any persons home or office to search without cause or without a warrantthe fact is the fbi the ins and even the local police could have gotten warrants based on the information they had in their possession but they chose not to for a variety of reasons besides no matter how distasteful or ignorant it is it is not illegal to speak badly about america or its leaders likewise it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward meccaconsider this until lee harvey oswald actually fired his rifle at president john kennedy he wasnt really breaking any laws living in a free society has its drawbacksstill path to paradise is a must see film that i am afraid will never be seen by that many people as far as i know it is not on dvd and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals of itim not really surprised people dont like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs right and for the pettiest of reasons like jurisdictional squabbles and a refusal to share informationthis is a shame as path to paradise is well done and gripping and as many have stated before the final scene where ramzi yousef played by art malik the bomber who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt at destroying the two towers is flying past the world trade center after his capture and extradition simply says next time we will bring them both down is a film moment that froze me in place for several minutes,1,0,negative,
this film illustrates the worst part of surviving war the memories for many soldiers men and women alike returning home can be the beginning of real problems i am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from wwii for one of my uncles the war was never over he survived the dday invasion something akin to the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan for him the memories not only lingered but tortured him he became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins his sons jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war in a different country the result is the same when i saw this at the kc filmfest i was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change the idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in iraq and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is rightthe tag line from the vietnam war film platoon says it all the first casualty of war is innocence,1,0,negative,

everything about this show is terrible its premise even sets itself up to get cheap laughs with bad writing a disfunctional familytheme has already been used too many times most notably by the simpsons which is an excellent show with great writing and many laughs meanwhile family guy has about five minutes of story in each episode with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in now if this was original or funny sure id think it was clever but no its not funny at all in fact the only reason the episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to effortlessly crank out episode after episode of this junk much of this show is unoriginal and what is original is just lame it is also amazingly crude and irreverent which again can be fine if its still intelligent animation isnt everything either but from an artistic point of view this show fails also proving yet again that family guy strives for as many cheap jokes and easy shortcuts as possible people enjoy this show and i dont really care because people can enjoy anything they want no matter how much it aims for the lowest common denominator but no i dont recommend this especially for anyone who wants to someday study film or become a writer this is cheap entertainment that aims low and has found success in this the fact that this is so successful says bad things about america,0,1,positive,
jacqueline hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual jackie hyde coproducer gabriella hall until her boss robert donovan fires her for taking personal calls at work however its not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather malcolm bennett has recently died that he left her his mansion fortune why doesnt stuff like that ever happen to me sigh very excited jackie heads on over there makes herself right at home while looking for the thermostat late one night jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance being a bit on the porky side jackie finally settles on the glamorous jacqueline blythe metz however jackies better looking alterego starts to take controlwritten coproduced directed by rolfe kanefsky i thought jacqueline hyde was complete total utter crap from start to finish its as simple straight forward as that according to the opening credits jacqueline hyde was inspired by the classic robert louis stevenson novel the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde frankly if mr stevenson could see what was being done to his story here hed turn in his grave for a start i think jacqueline hyde wasis intended to be a horror film the imdb certainly lists it as such but there isnt any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is i would say that jacqueline hyde is more a softcore porno than anything else extremely tame with it why sit down watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hardcore stuff that actually delivers the goods why thats the question i ask here its not even good porn either besides being far too soft its dull boring the notworthmentioning sex scenes are few far between the most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the jacqueline hyde 1998 title during the last century judging by the imdbs plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish this is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunitydirector kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but thats not an excuse these days shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap the few instances of cgi look like they came from a nintendo gameboy the final shocking twist has probably the worst morph effect ive ever seen is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when jackies breasts grow via more terrible cgi thats another thing the film takes itself far too seriously the subject matter sucks is far too predictable makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch alas it isnt so it isnt forget about any decent horror violence or gore as there isnt any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the endtechnically jacqueline hyde is home made film type stuff the photography is of the flat hand held pointshoot variety the music production design special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script the acting was awful seriously this is badjacqueline hyde in my opinion a load of crap there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that i can think of any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap definitely one to avoid,0,0,positive,
the beloved rogue is a wonderful period piece it portrays 145th century paris in grand hollywood fashion yet offering a bleaker side to existence there as it would be experienced by the poor and the snow its constantly swirling about adding to the severity of the setting brilliant the setting is enhanced by the odd cast of characters including beggars cripples and dwarfsa brilliant performance is turned in by john barrymore outdone only by the magnificent conrad veidt who portrays a degenerate dissolute louis xi to perfection and yes veidt picks his nose on purpose pushing his portrayal to wonderfully wry limits,1,1,positive,
highly flawed but just about watchable comedy that runs like a farrelly brothers reject the most criminal thing about it though is the casting i couldnt for one minute believe jerry o connell and jake busey in the role of superstuds who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat nor could i believe the very beautiful shannon elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions although the gross out meant to be shock comic scenes one involving an amputated testicle and another set in a sperm bank are just plain awful if this film is on tv then its probably worth watching if you are extremely bored but please dont waste your money renting it,0,0,negative,
it was a disappointment to see this dvd after so many years for me the main problems the uneven scriptwhile some of it is witty and hip quite a bit of it is dull unfunny and lifeless many of the gags just sit there lacking spark and energyof the cast mae west and rachel welch come over well roger herren in the role of rusty shines too bad he didnt make more films but for my money theres just too much of john huston and poor rex reed isnt hardly given a fighting chance his character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines wondering what hes doing in this filmthe low user rating should give an idea as to the publics opinion of this piece vidals original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted not even the classic film clips did much all in all a rather sub par effort and its not likely to get much better with time,0,0,negative,

at a time when hollywood thinks that louder faster and bloodier are better manna from heaven is comedic and touching look at something weve all thought about what would i do if a load of money fell from the skyinterestingly it took the characters many years to realize that the money hadnt made a single difference in their lives they all become what they were destined to be unfortunately in most cases what they became was unhappy in spite of their good fortune all those years agowhile manna offers the familiar hollywood storyline of good vs evil or in the case generosity vs greed what sets this film apart is that good wins out by converting evil not by crushing iti think the important message of this film is that you can change the world even if you do it one person at a time,1,-1,neutral,
yay i think its hard to say its hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion this movie is as sterile as a surgeons scalpel for a setting it has a few stone pillars some stone seats a couple stone crosses and some stone actors they have no emotion the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet and hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature the dubbing really wasnt all that bad though the voices stuck true to the dull gloomy dreary lifesucking atmosphere the movie gave forth i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater 3000 three times and each of the three times i was on the brink of turning off the tv despite it being mst 3knot an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better,0,0,negative,
this probably ranks in my top5 list of the funniest movies ive ever seen i was not a big fan of robin hood or robin hood prince of thieves but this movie was a lot different it made fun of robin hood and was hilarious i was extremely pleased with how well it was put together and how well acted it was besides home alone mrs doubtfire and houseguest this was the funniest move ive ever seen i especially love the song were men in tights if you have a good sense of humor youll love this movie,1,-1,positive,
this film really tries to hard if your going to make a horror film at least give it a reason to believe in to hook the viewer you wait and wait through the film expecting for some grand explanation but it doesnt instead it tries to be too clever ending and not revealing anything what was the point of the movie where its actually going and more importantly what the hell was going on why were they there and how does it tie into anything just another weak scifi horror i love the fake reviews on imdb saying how great it is by related press releases to bump the movie either that or people have low horizons its not worth your 2hrs at allim not saying the film is better than the fragile but at least that gave you reasoning and why things happened and has an end result this doesnt and it just waffles on with tons of padding to make everything feel scary this film is about as low as when a stranger calls god that was lame too big tip if your gonna make a horror make it believable with reasoning and explain to the viewer whats going on so they have a hook into your story because if theres no reasoning or believability then theres no firm hold on anything and it cant be scary no disrespect to the cast or crew cause they did a good job its just the poor writing,0,-1,positive,
unfortunately the director amos guttman died from aidsrelated illnesses the year after making this film so we dont know how many more gayrelated films we might have had from him i found this used dvd from cinevista on amazon but it looks like none of his other works are still available hessed mufla amazing grace contains full frontal male nudity at least in magazines which turn into a wishful dream sequence and some drug use this is the story of two families getting by or trying to but the mothers the daughters and the gay sons all have their own problems to figure out jonathan played by gal hoyberger meets up with the next door neighbor thomas who has his own problems of course either the translations are a little weak or maybe guttman kept the conversation sparse on purpose for a little mystery watching this i get the feeling were not getting the whole story but thats ok throw in a cute gay roommate exlover miki aki avni who went on to do many projects mostly isreali tv lots of smoking lots of worrying by the mothers a great blues song all night long blues done by an unknown female artist if she is listed in the creditssadly it was not translated to english nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect like any other relationship but then usa always has been years behind other countries in this way a good way to spend 98 minutes i wanted to see even more of it won awards at several film festivals acc to imdb and the film jacket,1,1,positive,
wow its been years since i last saw this movie watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986 initially i didnt think i would make it through the movie hunt stevenson michael keaton was so obnoxious arrogant and disrespectful that i found it hard to watch him he embodied every negative stereotype of americans if that wasnt bad enough once the small american towns finest workers were shown the image only got worse on the opposite spectrum the japanese were presented as emotionless robotic workaholics the movie wasnt even all that funny i only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it and im glad i continued the watchjust like boxing judges are swayed by how you finish the round this movie went from about a three up to the seven i rated it because of the ending the end was excellent you always want a harmonious ending and this was just that it was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory but what was most special was the marriage between the japanese customs and values and the american customs and values it was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note,1,1,positive,
what on earth has become of our dear ramu is this the same man who made sarkar satya and comapny i refuse to believe so if aag was ramus most ambitious project he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times this movie is made to fall like a brick i was cringing to leave the theater but i was forced to sit because i wouldnt have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left else nothing would have made me sit beyond intervalthis movie is nowhere close to sholay it doesnt even come near it within a mile i believe ramu surely loves the godfather more than sholay since sarkar was a classic piece of work i read ramus interview a couple of days back in which the interviewer said that ramu doesnt sleep for more than 4 hours a day that too not at a stretch i completely agree with this now as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the moviethere is no power in the performance amitabh bachchan doesnt even look scary he looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers i saw earlier ramus favorite nisha kothari did a fantastic job in sarkar because she didnt have many dialogs in fact none if i remember clearly she opened her mouth in this movie and has found a place in history the new guy playing jais role seems to have that brash look but didnt manage jais role at all i cant go on im sorry my pain is too big for me to manage right nowi promised myself throughout the movie that i will watch the original sholay once more just to see that it is still therebottom line horrible movie the media and critics are going to cook ramus goose and just to remind all readers once more i am one of the biggest ramu fans and even i cant spare him for this act,0,1,positive,
one of the previous reviewers wrote that there appeared to be no middle ground for opinions of love story one loved it or hated it but there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10 for me this movie rated a 4 there are some beautiful scenes and locations and ray milland turns in a fabulous job as olivers father but the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings at least not for me i may be a bit of a snob but i tend to avoid movies with ryan oneal i still havent seen barry lyndon because most of them but not all are ruined for me by his presence the lone exception is whats up doc in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for barbra streisands goofball protagonist and not coincidentally he takes a shot at love story for good measure mcgraw and oneal tend to mug their lines rather than act themthis movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career it was tommy lee joness first movie,0,-1,positive,

i really liked this movieeveryone has something to be blamed for everyone is real no paperboard heroes or cold omnipotent knowall charactersi read many others viewers here complaining about anne morality and about james will to maintain his love for her despite her cheating on him but i dont agreei found anne emily watson absolutely wonderful and i felt love for hershe was a heavily repressed woman her actions were not planned once she started to break free she was in confusion and did many errors but so its in real life when you gain freedom you are likely to do errors expecially at the start pointwas she a little too ungrateful maybe but we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time she knows that james after all is a good man maybe a little too stiff serious and work centered but she also feels the urge to live the life as herselfis she to blame more than him i think nobut the turn happening into their lives generates some changesjames instead of letting his wife go out of his life as other viewers suggested as the right choice bites the bullet and waits hoping for the better he starts to understand that what he superficially though was ok his marriage in reality was a control game played by him on his wifethis is not a story with characters having overemotional and precarious nature ie the usual clich latin american or italian jealous guys this is a story of men and women that use both heart and brainit can be very painful but if you really love a person women or man and if you are not a terribly unstable nature you are likely to forgive hisher cheating and let himher go unless you are a jealous prehistoric crimeofpassion inclined possessive and mentally instable individuala really good movie the last scene when james despite all the things happened before goes with anne to the train station is really moving she is free and he understood what freedom means for a personguido,1,1,positive,

it is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting it happens quite often not only is dark harbor uninteresting but it is very poorly done scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise a troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more troublesome movies build tension by building the story dark harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it i was hoping that like other movies the suspense would finally explode it never does also the characters have no continuity from scene to scene they may act one way in one scene but then act a completely different way in another scene at first you think that they are merely out of character but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all they are just props for the final twist the final ten minutes try to be shocking instead its rather lame and uninteresting the only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended at less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too longthis isnt one of those lowbudget gems its more like a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you take it home,0,0,negative,

bad news for anyone wanting to film a fulllength parody of a lifetime network movie the makers of a deadly encounter have already done it albeit unintentionally all of the lifetime tropes are there a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker an unreliable exhusband who of course cheated on her while they were married and a police department that patronizingly dismisses her complaints forcing her to stand up for herself especially jawdropping is the scene where the heroine after enduring a breakin and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker decides to relieve the stress by going shopping having seen first hand the harassment of a coworker by some creep she met at church i know stalking is not a joke but it certainly is in this movie,0,0,negative,

im not great at writing reviews so ill just spout my opinionsi loved this series at first the adventure the action the comedy the drama i thought it was all brilliant anderson tapping shanks judge davis i loved them all davis it seemed was the fifthmost important person in the cast not a big deal but when his character general hammond left at the end of the seventh season and andersons character colonel oneill moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff i dont know whether its because hammond was more important that i realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to the first seven seasons though were awesome the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasnt the original intention a brilliant setup to the series i recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the tv series then watch the movie again youll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me and then watch the rest of the tv seriesthe last three seasons of the series arent nearly as good as the first seven but that doesnt mean they arent good it just means theyre a letdown if youve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasonsafter you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series stargate atlantis it is a worthy successor to this brilliant seriesedit on 71808 i just found out that don s davis died a few weeks ago it is a great loss,1,1,positive,

having watched the first scene i realized the acting was so bad that it couldnt possibly pick up later superficial and artificial with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology the way a five yearold tries to make it sound as if he knows what hes talking about the secondtosecond storyline is completely unrealistic and just about every single decision the screenwriter did was the kind you expect from a belowaverage grade school student the overall storyline was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages the few attempts to make the dialogs sound intelligent was limited to neurotic apologetic behavior a ten yearold might like it but it would take a five yearold to accept the lack of realism how does advanced cell function allow someone to bypass a code lock by touching it as if with a magic wand pick out one out of 100s of voices through a ventilation system thereby ripping off superman and repair a home computer by just sensing whats wrong instead of looking for faults actually that scene is a neat example the fault was that one of the cooling pipes aluminum ribbons on the cpu was broken the way it would look if a exhaust pipe on a v8 engine is ripped off by an explosion this is something that cant happen and if it did it wouldnt prevent the computer from working there is no electrical current passing through this ribbon but when he without doing it himself his arms worked by autopilot because the cells in his body was super efficient put a pushpin into the rip a desktop with icons appeared on the screen immediately without bootingand so it goes all the way like when he escaped an interrogation room in the nsa headquarters by lighting a lighter below a fire sensor resulting in open doors throughout the building naturally nsa didnt predict this sharp witted approach to escaping nor did they put any guards outside his room or anywhere else to guard a living walking breakthrough in military nanotechnology so he walked out and got a cab examples like this one are not only numerous there is in fact just about no single scene that makes sense also the socalled great effects were terrible he threw a basketball back to a kid in the park and the kid was thrown back horizontally 20 feet into a tree no acceleration or deceleration but constant speed and height like a motorized trolley im sure if i paused and looked for the cables that kept the posture of this kid the way only cables can they probably didnt know how to or bother to erase them completely if someone is thrown that far into a tree they would at least say ouch or rather be hospitalized with broken bones but the kid was just just confused and amazedmoronic thats the word for every creative decision made throughout the entire production im going to put the directors name on my own personal blacklist someone as poorly skilled as him cannot improve i feel like demanding compensation for having wasted 45 minutes of my life for watching it and the time it took to write this although it felt therapeutic it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get a pilot approved the only excuse a slightly intelligent person could have to watch this voluntarily would be imprisonment or lobotomy,0,0,positive,

the horror of this made for tv film was that it didnt end with this one it spawned a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilotmovie most films about various professions have some type of realism to them and of course are jazzed up to make it exciting this had none of that if the intent was to make in camp then it succeeded it resurfaced on cable a couple of years ago and failed again richard jaeckels performance as the master chief who does it all was the only redeeming part of this film campier than the batman series of the 60s,0,-1,neutral,

this should have rocked vh1 moved away from the traditional divas whitney houston celine dion etc that had made the 2003 show so stale sadly the move backfired the show had no mc keeping the show together queen latifah did a fantastic show at the 2003 divas the show kicked of with a horrific rendition of lady marmalade featuring patti labelle cyndi lauper and jessica simpson okay in the studio with some control they can all sound great however when they are competing with each other why it just sounds torturous jessica simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that ive ever witnessed cyndi lauper also performed girl just wanna have fun that wasnt as bad but it was hardly impressive the worst was yet to come cyndi and patti labelle teamed up to perform cyndis hit time after time it was acoustic and didnt fit in with the rest of the show still it couldve been okay if they both hadnt insisted on squealing like mamed animals it was just diredebbie harry from blondie is always cool she has a style of her own and although maybe she cant compete vocally with a many of the divas although she certainly can sing very well debbie came out and performed blondies 1 hit rapture with some lovely vocals she really hit the notes perfectly she looked stunning rapper eve provided a new but sadly inferior rap it was good debbies next performance was a teamup with newcomer joss stone they performed the blondie hit one way or another i think joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted over debbie a rather sad bit was when debbie tried and failed to match her shouty style which spoiled it a bit she shouldve just let joss get on with her totally inappropriate warballing the whole of blondie performed this track the final track debbie performed was blondies massive hit call me it was pretty poor not debbies fault because you just couldnt hear her the sound was atrocious all the way through the showjoss stone also performed a few songs on her own they were quite well done ashanti also showed up to perform two inexplicable cover versions firstly she did diana ross im coming out and then chaka khans aint nobody she is not a diva she can sing to an extent but she has no presence whatsoever why not just get the real singers in chaka was even interviewed on the showgladys knight showed up and did a medley it was very good she was probably the best bit of the show i dont know much about her other than she is a seasoned performer in las vegas and her experience and class really shone through patti labelle fitted in another performance this time her 80s hit new attitude it was the finale and it was okay but it was too little to late this was one big dud better luck next time vh1the version i saw was a heavily edited 55min version which was shown on vh1 in the uk if these were the best bits,0,0,positive,
this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989 his characters constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison unfortunately sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent successful and funny manner when this film was made much like his character the majority of the films jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because hes too ugly and cant get women the film is hard to watch too because it doesnt treat itself like a real film sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film often referring to the films low budget or questionable content the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over for fear that if more found out about it it would ruin sandlers career pass this one up at the video store i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time,0,-1,neutral,

the silent film masterpiece battleship potemkin 1925 was commissioned by the soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905 and to establish the event as an heroic foreshadowing of the october revolution of 1917 ironically the films director sergei eisenstein was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to film art subsequently eisensteins formalism and suspect politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on socialist realism influenced by the russian film theoretician lev kuleshov and through him by d w griffiths intolerance smuggled into russia in 1919 eisenstein constructed his films from a collision of rapidly edited images a montage of shots varied in length motion content lighting and camera angle without question the most memorable illustration of eisensteins stylistic approach and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history is the odessa steps sequence in potemkinin structure potemkin is a five reeler divided into five narrative parts an organization clearly derived from the fiveact arrangement of western drama in men and maggots eisenstein dramatizes the prerevolutionary oppression and discontent of the battleships working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny even before the sailors and their upper class officersmasters are visually introduced eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea onboard ship we witness crowded unsanitary conditions eisenstein emphasizes the sailors dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings harsh labor and most memorably the maggot infested meat intended for the evenings meal the ships nearsighted physician is brought forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup boiling like the sailors rage in accordance with marxist maxims the church also fails the men and we see one of them smashing a plate inscribed with words from the lords prayer from two different camera angles in perhaps the first deliberate jump cut in cinema historyidentified by intertitles as drama on the quarterdeck and an appeal from the dead potemkins second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the onshore funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution vakulinchuk united by vakulinchuks appeals to brotherhood the initial mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers a chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by eisensteins editing techniques the officers quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed the ships doctor is thrown overboard accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggotridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging tragically vakolinchuks death is the price paid for the revolt no omelet without breaking eggs and he is laid out with dignity on an odessa pier hundreds of ordinary odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge death to the oppressors shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousnessthe complex and unforgettable odessa steps sequence constitutes the films fourth act it begins with uplifting music and a series of closeups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects parasol eyeglasses baby carriage suddenly as exclaims a title card in huge letters the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps here eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting cossacks below the miseenscene is framed by a statue of caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom symbolic metonyms for russias oppressive institutions tsarist monarchy and the orthodox christian churchpunctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children in the first a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughters first victims the boy is shot but the mother continues running until closeups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the sons fallen body being trampled by the crowd with a much slowed editing pace the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers shown only in a diagonal shadow line they summarily shoot her dead after this lull the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach the womb of mother russia as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage in a scene famously imitated in the untouchables the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom when the carriage reaches the bottom there is a cut to a cossack wielding a sword and a classic kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see the slaughtering of this pure and symbolic innocent the final series of shots in the odessa sequence is of three stone lions one in repose one sitting up and one roaring the editing animates them into a visual metaphor of the peoples awakened ragesomewhat anticlimactically the fifth act returns us to the battleship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await an encounter with other ships from the fleet they and the viewer expect retribution but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of comradeship eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years but that quibble aside battleship potemkin stands as one of the seminal works of the silent film era and it retains extraordinary cinematic power,1,-1,positive,
i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie againi have seen action films i have even liked quite a few of them but this one goes over the topnot only does it have the worst male actor ever sly stallone playing the lead role but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground would be hell of a lot easier that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it furthermore the plot has no real twists at all a three year old kid could guess what comes next it is a set of cliches of action genre with sly performing even worse than his other movies he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film now there is an actor who cant act a surprised b sad c anything else than his basic face i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it explosions are outstanding but then you can see better on the 4th of july landscapes are magnificient but then there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas so you can see better sights that way rather than waste time on this flickgo watch some other movie instead there are hundreds even thousands better action movies,0,-1,negative,
if youre looking for a kungfu action movie look elsewhere while there are fighting scenes the film revolves around its provincial protagonist who struggles to find her way in americanized canton unlike most kungfu comedies the action scenes are used to reinforce the comedy instead of the other way aroundcheung booi is a statement about the farcical nature of kungfu movies where the stars always seem to find some reason to fight instead of some grand drama about honor and respect minor misunderstandings cause the characters to yell at each other and start beating each other upmy young auntie as its known in the west is the story of cheng tainun played by kara hui who is a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to keep his holdings from falling into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother after he dies she moves to canton to live with her nephew played by director lau kar leung and his son ah tao played by hsiao hothe basis of the irony is that although cheng is the same age as ah tao her manner is more akin to her status as his stepgreataunt while ah tao speaks english extremely poorly plays the guitar and goes to costume parties cheng utterly fails when she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in canton complete with makeup revealing gowns high heels and dance sceneswhat makes this movie great is its realization lau kar leung is perhaps one of the greatest if not the greatest director of his generation in hong kong and kara hui won best actress at the first hong kong film awards in 1982 also this is arguably hsiao hos finest performance his chemistry with hui is remarkable and although he went on to have a storied career in kungfu comedies often working alongside sammo hung he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy as the romantic tension and intrigue build in the second half of the movie his entire countenance changes no longer does he easily jaunt through life without a care in the world he becomes the straight man and his cohorts the kramer elaine and georgemy one complaint is how suddenly the comedic aspects of the film die off during the conclusion the film transitions from outright farce to dramatic intrigue with little but a change in incidental music but there is a certain symmetry in it the film begins focused on the intrigue focused more on lau kar leungs character and it ends that way too but the final scene returns to the movies comedic roots giving conclusion to both aspects of the film,1,-1,positive,
it is one of the joys of shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances no single performance can be right but some can be wrong and this one is there are at least two things about hamlet which cannot be dispensed with 1 his indecisiveness and inability to take any kind of action for gods sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does if you had othello there instead of hamlet claudius would be dead by the end of act one any production has to try to explain why hamlet delays why he is incapable of action 2 his sexual disgust his total revulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an utter disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with ophelia is impossible at the slightest hint of sex hamlet throws up so what does mel gibson give us lusty actionman you could not get further from the character of hamlet if you tried there are lots of ways hamlet can be played but this isnt one of them what i dont understand is since they managed to get such good actors for the other parts claudius polonius and so on why couldnt they find one to play hamlet as well mark rylance in the part would have made this a great film this mel gibson whoever he is completely let down the rest of the cast and lets face it hamlet without the prince really doesnt work,0,1,positive,
i saw this movie during a tolkienthemed interim class during my sophomore year of college i was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy everyone else was laughing but they werent within constant eyesightlets get it out of the way the peter jackson lord of the rings films do owe something to the bakshi film in jacksons version of the fellowship of the ring for instance the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshis film shot by shot you could call this plagiarism or homage depending on your agenda im sure the similarities dont stop there im not going to do any research to find out what they are because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film im sure others have outlined the similarities look aroundthis movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor and many many people died in the accident ive decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion if ive left out anything else that offended me its because im completely overwhelmed confronted with a wealth of failure and at high points mediocritydue to heavy use of rotoscoping gandalf is no longer a gentle wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the filmsaruman the white is sometimes referred to as aruman during the film without explanation he wears purple and red for some mysterious reasonsam is flat out hideous the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying yes hobbits are small like children but they are not childrenmerry and pippin are never introducedthey simply appear during a scene change with a onesentence explanation the film is filled with sloppy editing like thisfrodo sam pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his backwhich was not visible beforeand begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into lalalas awfularagorn apparently is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic no pants complete with huge square pilgrim belt buckle he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movieoftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his assthe black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace this is disturbing to be sure but not frighteningthe scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen in which they stare at frodo who is on the other side on horseback goes on forever during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and do nothing else the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodos hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound it turns out to be more plodding than anything elsegimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf hes a dwarf there is simply no excuse for that he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome its a crude but accurate descriptionboromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudds golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode he looks ridiculousdespite the similarity to tolkiens illustration the balrog is howl inducing and the leastthreatening villain in the entire film it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers and its barely taller than gandalf purists may prefer this balrog but ill take jacksons version any daythe battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments im not asking for actionpacked scenes like those in jacksons film but they are supposed to be fightingtreebeard makes a very short appearance and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all watch the film youll see what i meanalright now for the good parts of the filmsome of the voice acting is pretty good it isnt that aragorn sounds bad he just looks kind of like the jolly green giantgaladriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal like tom bombadil she seems immune to the rings powers of temptation and her voice actress isnt horrible eitherboromirs death isnt as heart wrenching as in jacksons portrayal of the same scene but its still appropriately dramatic and more true to his death in the book though i dont believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he didas my professor pointed out between whispered threats the orcs mainly at helms deep if im correct resemble the warravaged corpses of soldiers a political statement that works pretty well if you realize whats being attemptedwhile this isnt really a positive point about the film bakshi cant be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie or so ive been toldthe project was on a tight budget and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higherups who im sure hadnt read the bookslet me be clear i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product overall i cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkiens classic trilogy even for laughs unless youve already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters places and events im sure somebody somewhere will pick a copy of this up in confusion if you do keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it,0,0,negative,

how to lose friends alienate people is not based on tiger woods infidelities it is a mediocre romantic comedy based on toby youngs book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities the film stars simon pegg as sidney young a zany british journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in new york young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him hence movie title he is uproarious daring and moronic but nevertheless for some very bizarre reason he is a somewhat likable character sidney befriends a fellow journalist the composed alison olsen played quite admirably by kirsten dunst however sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress sophie maes played by the fantastic ms megan fox this foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on eye candy material sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co those are the peak comedic moments of the film however i think that director robert weide and screenwriter peter straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic romcom material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between sidney alison even though team weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as sidney young jeff bridges was again building the dude bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as clayton harding the magazines suave prez but the rest of the films acting was not worthy enough to feature here how to lose friends alienate people should not be alienated entirely but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy average,1,1,positive,
two funeral directors in a welsh village english humour as opposed to that other stuff from over the atlantic how could i resist my wife and i saw it on march the 6th for our belated valentines day celebration and both of us enjoyed some good belly laughs we were going to see another movie later but decided not to because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us for the eveningthe mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the wait it raises issues rarely talked about in the community but i know three funeral directors and the humour is right on the moneyhighly recommended and congratulations to the writers without you all the actors directors and the others havnt a job on any monday,1,-1,positive,

the young victoria is a beautiful film and has presented queen victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks about her the films wipes away the i am not amused impression of queen victoria and shows she was a cheerful young womanas i love history particularly victorian history you can imagine my reaction when i first saw this film advertised i was so so so excited and counted down the days until it came to the cinemas i was a little worried that it wouldnt be historically accurate but it was and i loved it i found out new facts about queen victoria that didnt know before and it interested me greatlyqueen victoria in many lights was one of our all time greatest monarchs and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like she was treated so badly by her mothers adviser sir john conroy because he wanted britain to have a regency this was what inspired victoria to be a fantastic queen which she was the romance between her and albert was so deep and this was very well done by emily blunt and rupert friend who were both brilliant the young victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of british historyi love it 1010 no doubt,1,1,positive,

when the local sheriff is killed his wife takes over until and is determined to cleanup the town not everyone in town however is happy with what shes doing when the sheriff orders a curfew in town the local saloon owner also a woman hires a killer to take care of the sheriff theres no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution theres a good movie here somewhere trying to get out in more capable hands or with a larger budget gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the old west as it is gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie there are just so many things wrong with the movie a supporting cast with no acting ability stilted and unnatural dialogue and sets that look like sets but the biggest offender is the editing i was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors and horses for that matter obviously waiting for corman to yell action the best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building all of a sudden they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles or take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town we see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse its not as if corman didnt have a few decent actors to work with while none were great stars beverly garland john ireland and allison hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance but in gunslinger theyre not given much to work with i have now seen both the mst3k and nonmst3k versions of the movie i would strongly recommend going the mst3k route,0,-1,positive,

i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago perhaps the long wait was worth it since the criterion collection dvd restoration is impressivein its outline this movie follows the timeworn script a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault the heist takes place a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all even though the heist footage is transfixing it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film this film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on giving us two movies for the price of onejohn servais plays the idea man tony le stphanois always referred to as le stphanois with such worldweariness that he could have just stepped out of a camus novel tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists reentering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his exlover who has taken up with another man where as punishment he physically whips her with a belt thankfully that scene occurs off camera but you are not likely to forget it after that sobering event since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship tony meets with two of his old partners in crime jo and mario and decides to join them in one last big heist they enlist the services of cesar an italian safe cracker played by director dassin himself and we are off to the heistthe heist goes off without a hitch but cesars womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned however we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir filmit is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and his family in fact jos son refers to him as uncle i think it is partly to help jos family that tony agrees to the heist the ending scenes where tony saves the life of jos kidnapped son partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions but only partially,1,1,positive,

sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones well thats my opinion anyway this one will always be in the bad movie category simply because all but shu qis performance was terriblemartial angel tells of cat shu qi a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover chi lam julian cheung two years before but her past returns to haunt her as chi lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company cat works for in order to rescue him she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days six other feisty women to save the dayi may have told the synopsis cheesily but this is a cheesy story in fact the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as ricepaper in water if i could sum it up take a bad jackie chan movie remove the comedy remove the choreography throw away the budget and you have martial angels a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at allmind you i do have to give credit where credits due and shu qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action as it was her performance that shone through okay you cant say she was excellent after all she had absolutely nothing to work with but she did manage to dig some character out from her role other than that only sandra ng and kelly lin made any other impression although these were mostly glimmers and very briefelsewhere the film just fell to pieces scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes camera angles that were elementary and unflattering and direction ive seen better from a lost dogi guess this film was a too many cooks affair most probably the budget was blown away on the overenthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen that didnt leave much elsefrankly the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn charlies angels it aint in fact while sisters can do it for themselves none of that was really that apparent heredefinitely one to forget,0,0,positive,

wwe has produced some of the worst payperviews in its history over the past few months cyber sunday survivor series and december to dismember were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its b brand show smackdown to attempt to end the year on a high note armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and inferno matches three championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring batista and john cena against king booker and finlay however it was an amendment to one of those championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present tlo changed the wwe tag team championship match from champions london and kendrick against to regal and taylor to a four team ladder match including mnm and the hardy boyzi am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing i can say would be able to do it justice this has to be seen to be believed there were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings the one move i have to talk about however was the one that took joey mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force unfortunately for mercury he didnt get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye this was vicious his face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended mercurys night early we found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye be warned this is not for the faint of heart the ending to this rollercoaster of a match came after paul london managed to grab both championship belts for the victory i have been watching wrestling for almost 15 years and it doesnt get any better than this match unbelievablethe night opened with only the 4th ever inferno match kane took on mvp in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action there were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was kane who forced mvp onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring mvp ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this may i suggest to michael hayes that mvp comes out next week on smackdown to johnny cashs ring of firethe other gimmick match of the night and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker this was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet the used poles chairs and one scene had the undertaker thrown 15 feet from the armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash mat and crowd didnt pop for this the ending came after a chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a matchwinning tombstonein other notable happening from the card chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero by submission in another stiff match this was a very good bout with benoit hitting 8 german suplexes on chavo at one time benoit was also considering whether to put vikki guerrero in the sharpshooter or not luckily he came to his senses and let her go this led to chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submissionanother cracking match on the card was the cruiserweight championship contest between the longest reigning champion in wwe gregory helms and jimmy wang yang featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots some of which took place outside the ring this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got jbl put it best when he berated the fans in richmond virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to smackdowns resident redneckthe boogeyman pinned the miz in a worthless match i hate the boogeyman with a passion only worth listening too for jbls ranting about miz jbl is comedy goldthe last match of the night was main event number 3 world heavyweight champion batista and wwe champion john cena teamed up to take on finlay and the champion of champions king booker there was no way the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have i said that about wwe matches this year already it was king booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big batistabombso 2006 is over for the wwe in regards to its payperview schedule it started the year on a terrible note with new years revolution but ended on a high one with armageddon this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time my hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match,1,0,positive,

i found this movie at a xxx store for 1 on vhs the interesting thing about it is that camp video bought up the rights to it and slapped on a 1986 copywrite date in the credits anyways enough of odd factsthis film is absolutely not scary to even call this horror or a thriller is laughable there were only maybe 5 minutes at most of what you would call horror in this 80 minute film and that consisted of the acting because it was horrorible all puns aside the writing for this film was absolute garbage as well just as the special effects and makeup was laughable no wonder this is such an obscure film probably the director has spent the last 35 years scouring the country for all existing copies of it and burning them in one big pile so no one else could be subjected to it,0,-1,neutral,

im sure all of the canadians on imdb are all too familiar with canadian content and how much of it is well shall we say lackluster there are a select few canadian shows that are actually worth watching however this is definitely one of themsimple premise two guys picking up girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules add in some witty and clever commentary from a group of surprisingly likable selfproclaimed alpha males and you have yourself some very entertaining programming each episode is solid if the players are subpar there are some awkward moments to be had and there is some gentle fun poked at them if the players are good it leads to moments that you just have to stand up and applaud and some comical praise lavished at themthe premise is kind of trashy i know and as a guy who usually takes pride in the fact that im elevated himself above typical terrible reality television it takes a lot for me to admit that this show is actually funny and enjoyableone thing that must be pointed out is how the comedy network did a terrible job marketing this show for the longest time i didnt even know the premise and all i knew was that there was somehow a shirtless guy who loves cougars involved however after actually watching the show i was surprised by how surprisingly slick it looks for canadian content despite a pretty lame opening credits sequence so give it a chance i have yet to find someone in the target demographic 1830 year old males who have actually watched the show and not just the annoying commercials who hasnt liked itbring it back for a third season comedy network it actually has a good premise as opposed to some other canadian shows youve had coughgirls will be girlscough i usually reserve 1010 ratings for works of art but i just have so much fun watching this show and i think that it has been unfairly judged my many that i just had to,1,0,positive,

i must have seen this movie about four or five times already and it gets better with each viewing suffice it to say this is the best film ive ever seen and i think ive seen a lotbut ive always wondered why this film got so shunned in some reviews or ratings for example take the imdb top 250 why does it rank only at 216 as of today surely the answers not in the film itself because that is nothing but flawless but in its reception the film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its antideath penalty attitude and so obviously the more conservativeminded user probably didnt like the film as you can see from some of the other comments so dead man walking gets a ranking thats nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality those people didnt understand what the film wanted to say and maybe they didnt want to understand being pro death penalty so now i get it its all political youre pro death penalty you dont like and therefore dont want to hear what the film has to sayim truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefsmr robbins your movies issue split peoples opinions some reconsidered their pointofview some simply didnt listen but you made a very important point your movie will probably never show up on any top 100 movies of all timelist but itll be remembered long after films like braveheart or babe or apollo 13 all of which were unjustly preferred over your film at the oscars 1996 are forgotten congratulations mr robbins and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking,1,-1,positive,

rock n roll is a messy business and dig demonstrates this masterfully a project of serious ambition and perhaps foolhardiness the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups with that said the abundance of quality material ensures the films ability to captivate the audience if youve ever been interested in any realm of the music industry this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing the music in the film although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting is worth the price of admission alone the morning after i saw dig i went straight to the record store to pick up a brian jonestown massacre album i was already initiated to the dandy warhols sounds primarily defined by its exploration of rock music the film succeeds at other profound levels dig is a sincere and sufficiently objective glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces,1,-1,neutral,

i rented the video of the piano teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box i did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad unfortunately this one falls in the latter category about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud this movie is boring about half way through i was saying to myself where have i seen this before at the three quarters mark i had figured it outin spite of its literary origins this film is essentially a remake of robert altmans much earlier 1969 and better that cold day in the park although the details obviously differ and altmans work was more plotdriven and less of a character study the two films are thematically identical there is nothing new to be seen in this production every aspect of it has been done before a character spiralling out of control with increasingly selfdestructive behavior abel ferraras bad lieutenant 1992 a perverse and doomed love culminating in an operatic near death scene david cronenbergs m butterfly 1993 uncommonly brutal sex scenes david lynchs blue velvet 1986 and so on hence i am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking shattering etc this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable and clearly succeeded with some however i largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of filmviewing experience see enough movies and you really will eventually have seen it all and while it is true that i saw the expurgated rrated version i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of the piano teachertechnically the film is not without merit there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent isabelle hupperts creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time this is the first of hanekes films that ive seen and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of ferrara an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be rating 410,0,0,positive,
i feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film it is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake or perhaps their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart looking for any reason at all to dislike themthe long kiss goodnight is an action film in every sense of the word sure there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself i have never been a big geena davis fan but i was impressed with how she was able to create two very different characters samantha cain and charlie baltimore in my opinion it wasnt even necessary to have changed her physical appearance to differentiate between the twoher acting was more than enough to do the trickmore than anything else though this film was craig bierkos in anothers hands the character of timothy couldve been just another interchangeable villain his decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the right counterpoint to all of the action scenes it isnt often that you find an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expressionspoint in case the scene in the freezer with charlie and her daughter where most films wouldve cluttered the moment of revelation with unnecessary dialogue bierkos eyes told the whole storythe basic plot thin to be truthful a seemingly average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she had been an assassin as her memory returns so do the people who want the assassin dead is she really samantha the cookie baking housewife or charlie the cold blooded assassin or maybe a little bit of both for me the long kiss goodnight was an enjoyable journey to find out,1,-1,neutral,

this is arguably the best film director haim bouzaglo made until now a skilled tv director welltrained in storytelling and in directing his actors through long epics he tried to catch in this very lowbudget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks resulting in distorted lives each character trying to live his own life to watch and control the other while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure by political and historical forces well beyond his control some call this destiny but destiny has a very concrete representation in this filmthere is no explicit political saying in distortion characters never discuss politics not even at the level of saying bastards when they hear that a new terror attack happens their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded they do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb and waiting for the next one to happen personal social professional life seems to work someway but is deeply flawed and influenced by events the main character played by the director is a playwright whose midlife personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that he is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes he hires a private detective to follow his girlfriend who is a tv investigative reporter whom he suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show another failed man former military whose business and family life dismantles under the events he starts to write a play that carboncopies the reality and will bring it to the stage in theater in film scene that reminds hamlet as well as synecdoche new york its not that i would dare suspect charlie kaufman looking over the shoulder of bouzaglo he certainly needs not that but the israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film and the first directed by kaufman as in the american film actors play real persons and start interacting with them in an realitymeetsstagemeetsreality melange which never lacks logic at least not artistic logicbouzaglo directs his actors with the usual talent trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them his style is much more free here than in his tv series and the distortion effects although borrowed from american horror movies work pretty well all over the ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film,1,1,positive,
this is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if art bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that carl kolchak exemplified of course there probably wouldnt be an xfiles if this show hadnt prepped this audience for it so well darren mcgavin is not exactly the superheroic type but he is a plausibleenough guy to deliver heroic deeds check out his work on some of those old alfred hitchcock presents here he is the main attraction there doesnt seem to be a girlfriend or wife whos a distraction in fact there isnt a whole lot of sex appeal to the show something im noticing as well is that the pacing isnt really suspenseful in a typical way theres a lot of throwaway humor to this show sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax theres a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present mad men show in terms of style not that david chase writes mad men but the people that worked under him on the sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his seriocomic tone,0,-1,neutral,
this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in its kind the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is sand honest to the spectator an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience no this is not miss marble a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute not just to see,1,-1,neutral,
i like this movie above all others it is multilayered there is so much to see and appreciate every viewing brings a new appreciation of the storyline the plot and the characters faultlessly acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it i love the interaction between the players the subtle relationships the period atmosphere ralph fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by colin firth the scene in the sand storm where catherine elmasy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the highlights of the film and where the affair really starts the other relationship between hanna elmasy is yet another layer of the movie which is totally enchanting and heartrending a worthy winner of so many awards,1,-1,positive,
giant robot was the most popular japanese tv serial ever seen on indian tv it was targeted to children and we saw a robot for the first time in our life many indian children must have even seen a machine for the first time outside the school textbooks the serial also showed a child in an adults organization fighting evil no doubt many of us who have seen giant robot in our childhood long for our own robots and as a stopgap arrangement look upon our computers in the same way this show also portrayed ideal adults referring at jerry johnnys buddy friend and unicorn chief azuma we grew to respect japanese progress and still view japan as the ideal asian nationbtw at that time there were no satellite tv channels in india and the govt owned broadcaster did not show much of disney cartoons i guess that was how child serials like giant robot got appreciated nowadays there is pokemon etc but they are no so fascinating or alluring as giant robot,1,-1,neutral,
this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped though i will concede that the ideas behind batman forever were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director as it turned out this was not to be the caseapparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series i fail to understand how batman returns can be considered at all disappointingtrue it is not quite the equal of the first film though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in batman a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film true to the way the batman was always meant to be and highly satisfyingmichael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne tangling with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck christopher walken named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor his partnerincrime oswald cobblepot the penguin danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence oliviers richard iii and selina kyle the catwoman michelle pfeiffer whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman the four principals turn in excellent performances especially walken and devito while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identitiesthere are some intriguing concepts in this film about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a fourcornered fight there simply isnt enough time to properly explore whats going onnevertheless this is a damn good film i highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton,1,1,positive,
this movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet i like barney more than this movie the graphics suck half the movie is animated the deaths suck and over all i was ready to sue the people that made this movieplease do not waste hours of your life watching this movie the only good part was when the movie ended this movie is 50 percent jurassic park 1 percent sabretooth and 499 percent dumb please do not waste your time watching this movie you will regret ityou want to know why this movie sucks well the cover sucked the graphics sucked the blood looked i mean is ketchup the people tried to blow themselves up the college students think there all that and can stand up to the animal i mean there was a 5 ft tiger running straight at a woman she throws a spear at it from 100 ft away wait till you can actually hit it the acting was horrible too jurrasic park is actually a good movie and this just had to go and ruin it,0,0,negative,
well unlike most people i went into this movie expecting it to not be that good and it turned out to be an awesome film pretty cool plot i love the idea of it but what really made this movie was the actors they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see fishburn and dillon work together its a movie where you go in thinking right away you will be able to predict whats going to happen but it doesent quite turn out how you predicted i dont want to give away anything about the story so i wont but i suggest giving this one a chance if you saw the movie money train and enjoyed that you would love this movie maybe everything lawrence fishburn touches is gold,1,-1,positive,
i dont care what anyone says this movie was crap the only thing it had going for it was camera work which was very well done as for the dialogue i have heard so many people talk aboutit sucked too yes it was honest and true to life but so what i can hear anyone talk like that on the street or in a fast food joint what made the dialogue good in movies like pulp fiction and gosford park was the fact that it is written dialogue that takes time to think through another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture i believe that the male character could have been a lot stronger but instead it seemed weak in fact the movie seemed to revolve around the male character and then he completely disappears in the last twenty minutes the girl in the film i found completely repulsive not in appearance but in her needy needy ways saying she is in love with a guy and actually getting jealous of him the next day what a crock of crap final thing the sound was terrible and i hope it was only something that plagued my theater instead of actually being on the final cut of the film there was a constant buzzing sound during several scenes and it was actually taking away from the talking going on the one good thing again was bloods job as the dp but the actress that played the main guys ex girlfriend did a very good job as well these two things couldnt save an ultimately terrible movie which i refuse to call a film 210,0,0,positive,
i have seen most if not all of the laurel hardy classic films i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly even after watching it over and over again this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel hardy however fails miserably for various reasons one of which is how out of place their cloths are still early 20th century however are both portrayed in the 90s setting some of the former dialogue was brought back however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever the real laurel hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation,0,0,positive,
in the goofs section for this film theres a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where augustes car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene this is incorrect one of the views is from augustes flat the other is from valentins flat across the street the whole purpose of this segment is to show how valentin and auguste who may be made for each other almost cross paths as happens several other times but never quite do so until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film and here there is the implication that joseph has manipulated things so that auguste is on that ferry having inspected valentins ticket to see which sailing she is booked on,1,-1,neutral,
the bank 1915 chaplin the bank was one of charlies 1915 essanay films while these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts this one seems a bit below average the gag with the janitorial double combolocked vault and the toughluck ending that has charlie waking up from a dream in which he is stroking the lead ladys hair only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow are both classic chaplin moments they are both ironically the beginning and the end the middle is filled in with fighting with the rival coworker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl the mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not the mop seems to be charlies alterego doing things he wishes he could do but wouldnt with his own two hands interesting stuff but theres better,0,1,positive,

i never saw the other two ninja movies and for all i know there are known but for some reason i watched this one this one starts out rather fast as this one ninja goes on a super killing spree he is almost unstoppable as it takes quite a number of bullets to take him down he is not out for the count though as he ends up possessing a woman and he then continues his killing ways by using her as his tool another ninja enters the fray and apparently the only way you kill a ninja is with another ninja so he volunteers this leads up to a big battle at the end as the dead ninja goes back into his body and they have it out in an all out war sounds better than it actually turned out being but at least it was not boring,0,0,negative,
errol flynn had quite a gift for comedy that was sadly rarely exploited given the right material this film demonstrates that he could have happily been quite at home in cary grant style gentle comedies out of his various forays into the genre this is certainly the best patti brady gives a fine performance in the child part and eleanor parker looks simply stunning throughout the film an added bonus is the wonderful hattie mcdaniel who is sadly underused in this film a welcome presence none the less flynn carries off his comedic duties with the same easy style that he brought to his swashbuckling roles the fact that he makes it look like its easy doesnt mean that it is a super little family comedy great for the christmas period or any other time you feel like being cheered up,1,1,positive,
thats what i kept asking myself during the many fights screaming matches swearing and general mayhem that permeate the 84 minutes the comparisons also stand up when you think of the onedimensional characters who have so little depth that it is virtually impossible to care what happens to them they are just badly written cyphers for the director to hang his multicultural beliefs on a topic that has been done much better in other dramas both on tv and the cinemai must confess im not really one for spotting bad performances during a film but it must be said that nichola burley as the heroines slutty best friend and wasim zakir as the nasty bullying brother were absolutely terrible i dont know what acting school they graduated from but if i was them id apply for a full refund post haste only samina awan in the lead role manages to impress in a cast of socalled british talent that well probably never hear from again at least thats the hope next time hire a different scoutanother intriguing thought is the hideously fashionable soundtrack featuring the likes of snow patrol ian brown and keane now im a bit of a music fan and im familiar with most of these artists output but i didnt recognise any of the tracks during this movie apart from the omnipresent run bsides anyone we get many many musical montages which telegraph how were suppose to feel these are accompanied by such startlingly original images as couples kissing by a swollen lake and canoodling in doorways this is a problem as none of the songs convey the mood efficiently and we realise the director lacks the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue alonethe ending is presumably meant to be just desserts as everybody gets their comeuppance and there is at least one big shock in store but i remained resolutely unmoved because the script had given me noone to root for its not enough to tackle a hotbutton issue you have to actually give us a plot that hasnt already been done to death and individuals who are more than window dressing as it stands this film is a noble failure with only the promising lead actress and a few mildly diverting punchups to save it from the bin 410 must try harder,0,0,positive,
this is easily the best cinematic version of william faulkners fiction that ive ever seen and ive seen several of the most prominent ones filmed in faulkners hometown of oxford mississippi it really captures the feeling of jefferson and yoknapatawpha county intruder in the dust is not one of faulkners best novel but even if it is a clich to say this it would be the crown jewel in any one elses career it beats harper lees good but simplistic to kill a mockingbird fifty feet into the ground i read that one in ninth grade and thats exactly where it belongs two of faulkners most prominent characters play major parts in the film gavin stevens and lucas beauchamp stevens is probably the single most common character in all of faulkners fiction hes a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator because unlike many of his other characters stevens is a man of logic not emotion at least when hes older lucas beauchamp may be the most prominent of all of faulkners black characters he plays a major part in one of faulkners outandout masterpieces go down moses unlike all of the other black folks in yoknapatawpha he refuses to bow down to any white man he has pride and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man one day lucas is found standing over a dead white man with a recentlyfired pistol in his possession most of jefferson and the surrounding areas dont see the need for a trial and everyones pretty sure that beauchamp will be lynched before the evenings over or at least the next day as the murder and arrest occurred on a sunday beauchamp on the other hand declares his innocence and tries to get stevens to help him stevens refuses the case seems open and shut but his young nephew chick mallison because lucas had helped him in the past is willing to help him nowas far as i know no hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one hollywood films rarely persecute the black population but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles if youre an african american actor you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy the maid the servant or the porter because thats the only way youll work in intruder in the dust there is to be found one of the most memorable nonporter roles a black actor ever had lucas beauchamp and beauchamp as i described above is no stereotypical character and might have been hard for audiences to accept even today black characters are usually simple magical and kind the recent arthouse hit far from heaven is a great example of that beauchamp is kind of a jerk and hes very stubborn although hes perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel hes not any kind of stereotype hes a complex human being juano hernandez plays beauchamp extraordinarily well i havent seen the film in a while but he also appears in robert aldrichs 1955 film kiss me deadly as well as the cinematic adaptation of faulkners final novel the reiversall the actors are great in the film i should also praise quickly claude jarman jr who has the great role of chick mallison the novel takes place from his point of view and he is the conventional hero of the picture jarman is quite an actor he captures the character who also appears elsewhere in faulkners fiction narrating for example events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel the town perfectly he would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated john ford film rio grande the only other film of clarence browns that ive seen is national velvet quite a different picture than intruder in the dust his job here is exceptional i really have to credit him with capturing faulkner perfectly other famous faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic the long hot summer filmed in 1958 which i really like despite that or too cold tomorrow filmed in 1972 which i do not like that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of faulkner the only other one that really does well according to its source material is douglas sirks great 1958 filming of pylon really a different sort of faulkner novel altogether tarnished angels 1010,1,1,positive,

i rented this tv movie version of troilus and cressida out of my library last thursday and simply could not believe my eyes where should i begin no effort was made to make the play look remotely like it was about the trojan war all the actors were wearing elizabethan dress moreover most of the actors were too old and horribly miscast aeneas with his white beard looked older than nestor troilus was at least 30 hector looked like a spanish pirate ajax was badly played anyway and thersites was a transvestitelikewise the action is poor the duel between ajax and hector is short and amateurish the camera angle focuses more on nestors face so we can only see what is going on in the background which is frustrating in itself nor is the battle at the end given its due respect we do not see troilus and diomedes fight nor anyone else for that matter paris and menelaus just seem to mud wrestle in front of thersites even patroclus death was omitted all this was a major disappointment considering i waded through a very dull 2 and a half hours of bbc costume drama to get to that pointnonetheless it wasnt all bad i thought the incredible orlando as thersites and john shrapnel as hector were well played even if they didnt look quite right id say the same about kenneth haigh as achilles since he didnt have the striking countenance and was a bit dry at times spoiler the climax at the end the death of hector was perhaps the best part of the film achilles dialogue here is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold seasoned murderer however the gruesomeness of the scene when achilles stamps on what was hectors headsets it apart anywaycharles gray as pandarus was delightful as a sleazy old pervert and i thought the actress playing cressida did an ok job the warmongering troilus however was annoying and i think that the play would have been better perhaps if he had been murdered by achilles instead of a peacenik like hectorconclusion ok but could have been better if it had had a younger cast and costumes that at least attempted to look ancient grecian not to mention the lack of action 510,0,0,positive,

i saw this episode of masterpiece theatre and immediately came to imdb to look it up i was greeted by a comment from another user who believed that it was nothing special a 6 out of 10 and underwhelming i would feel morally remiss if i didnt disagreenow i am an avid fan of masterpiece theatre but oftentimes the stories can be a bit silly on television for example he knew he was right was absolutely horrendous carries war however is probably the best ive seen so far the entire cast does an excellent job and it held my interest more than any other piece ive seen recently the character mr evans is of particular interest and through subtle images of for example an untouched birthday cake or a garnet ring my opinion of him went from bad to truly good truly his ultimate demise and the story of how everyone around him left him a cold hard man is what brought out the bittersweet in this story for methe end is gratifying in every sense but one that everyone did not get what they deserved but overall things worked out i absolutely recommend this to everyone,1,-1,positive,
first of all this is an art film and a good one at that i loved the presentation and way it was shot very cool certain scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences ive ever seen this film did scare me not because of suspense or shock but because i was deathly afraid that id soon see something really appalling that did happen in a few places but mostly at the beginning this film also dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long however if youre into film you have to see this to date ive seen nothing like it 810,1,-1,positive,
to summarize my group of friends and i spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes plot inconsistencies untied loose ends and other ridiculous aspects of this movie i found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from jurassic park 1 the editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling in short this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpointeven the new dinosaurs were few and far between although i really enjoyed the pterodactyls we got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the actionas a scientist and former childhood paleontologist the lack of any real scientific content not that it had to be realistic but logically formed ie how they built the dinos in 1 and malcoms chaos ramblings was disappointing as wellin short the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money i hope that moviegoers dont fall for this trap again although i did apparently,0,0,positive,

after watching stoploss i find myself against disappointed in hollywood for making such a stinker gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940s that made one proud to be an american fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home what we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid antibush radicals the story tells of three young men who return home from the war one descends into outofcontrol madness culminating in his death the main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war and destroys his best friends relationship with his fianc at the same time the third truly is the hero of the story electing to continue the fight that was brought to our shores nearly eight years ago what makes this movie bad is not the acting but the premise behind it we are lead to believe that decorated soldiers are in fact haters of our country desertion is akin to treason in a time of war and the main protagonist flirts with it throughout the movie this paradox is designed to weaken the audiences reaction to the central act of the movie we are not supposed to find fault with king since he wears medals but his actions dont just merit it but cry out for it he is not an antihero in order to accept the movie the audience must accept the correctness of desertion because the story paints king as nothing else short of a hero i cannot accept that since it is like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day furthermore derision for the real hero is heaped upon the man who reenlists and continues to serve his country i would only recommend this stinker to someone who needs convincing of the decay of hollywood as it is a clear example of it no wonder it fared poorly in the box office,0,0,positive,
at a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is overpowering fiction as we know it on the small and big screen apart from that is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest fresh and innovative in there presentation than i have ever seen before the usual spoon feeding conventions are non existent in this film leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments trickle one after the other on the screen while watching the movie and even upon post contemplation it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that performances every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives even so apart from that does not feel like a documentary or reality television but instead transcends into a category of its own with its unique cinematography and direction i look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors jennifer shainin and randy walkerthis movie must be seen,1,1,positive,

in the opening sequence of wheres poppa george segal rises from his bed one morning shaves showers puts on a gorilla suit and goes into his mothers bedroom we realize later to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her out of his life forever this is about the level of humor one can expect from most of this picture insanity blended with what might be taken as morbid daringsegal plays a new york attorney who lives with his supposedly senile mother ruth gordon whose life is further complicated when while hiring a nurse to care for the old bag meets the girl of his dreams the pleasantly prim trish van devere decked out like florence nightingale his dilemma how to integrate the lovely nurse into his and his pesky mothers lifesegals performance is about the only thing holding the picture together his frustrations his reactions his comic timing is almost peerless whatever happened to that guy where the film fails is in other areas ruth gordons characterization is dreadful as the mother at the beginning you cant figure out if her character is senile or just being deliberately vague to keep her son from moving out by the end its clear shes just nuts when segal brings van devere home to meet her gordons eyebrows furrow and she gets a mean sinister look she wants the intruder in her sons life removed shes calculating this is not the mode of a senile person youre not getting a consistent performance throughout the picture which is probably the directors carl reiner fault as much as gordons ruth gordons old lady in rosemary baby is much more successful because with the kind of ingratiating cloying person that ruth gordon generally plays the audience responds to her as annoying but when mia farrow is too timid to fight back gordon becomes more cloying her fangs dig deeper and deeper and were frightened for farrow this kind of imposition is genuinely terrifying here were being asked to laugh at what wed normally find annoying and if gordon played it as helplessly nutty all the way we might but shes selfish and mean as well and it dampens what little humor there isthere are a few good laughs though a courtroom scene with barnard hughes as a military officer and rob reiner as a counterculture punk is fairly hilarious and vincent gardenia does a nice turn as a lombardiesque football coach theres also an inspired bit where segals brother ron liebman having been stripped naked by muggers on his way to segals place asks him for something for to wear home and he gives him the gorilla suitbut of a lot of the script is poorly conceived and simply doesnt make sense why is a new york lawyer with his own practice even living at home in the first place why does segal if his mother is senile try to reason with her logically if you spoil this for me ill punch your fing heart out why does liebman keep cutting through the park if he knows hes going to get mugged why does he take a taxi after leaving segals with gorilla suit why wasnt he taking taxis all along a funnier bit would have been liebman as the gorilla terrorizing the muggers why does van devere keep coming back after her first husband was a kook why does she want to get involved with this bunch i suppose if i put this to carl reiner hed say these are crazy people they dont have to make sense which is a convenient way to excuse a lousy script thats full of holes the characters momenttomoment behavior may not have to make sense but their motivations do and thats where wheres poppa falls apart the situations are created just to have the gag and the gags are mostly oneshots they dont build to anythingcarl reiner is the most guilty in this whole fiasco how he has acquired this vaunted reputation as a pillar of comedy puzzles me basically his career has been to hold a microphone in front of sid caesar and mel brooks while they talk in funny voices his son rob has ten times the skill and intelligence as a director in showbiz terms reiner pushes buttons a monkey could do his job and that is most apparent in his framing of the action why is all of new york shot in tight and in closeups but the scenes in the country are all distant and panoramic thats the mentality of carl reiners direction claustrophobic for the city spatial for the country in the final lunatic scene at the old folks home the camera is so far off you cant even make out whats going on the abrupt ending suggests a resolution that segal could have easily arrived at ninety minutes ago it also suggests reiner couldnt figure out how to end the picture so he just cut it as another example of craziness reiner seems to think dumbness equals craziness and craziness without logic is always funny it isnt and the creators of wheres poppa are as demented as ruth gordon putting pepsi in her fruit loops,0,0,positive,
i have never danced flamenco before but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect the colors how blatant the dances were the gypsies and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agree that this film may be his best production i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make iberia i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras while watching this movie i felt like i was sitting in a small restaurant in madrid comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail for me this movie fit like a glove i dont know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list,1,-1,positive,

warning some possible plot spoilers as if that was possibleokay if you havent figured out the plot yet i am going to give it to you two couples head out to a camping site but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhemnow it is time for me to give these couples some advice1 never ever go to camp dubbed camp blood by the locals 2 dont have sex or make out in front of the killer 3 dont go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away 4 dont yell profanity at the killer 5 make sure your cellular phone works before you go camping 6 everybody needs to bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it on themselves at all times 7 wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes no tight and binding clothing and no high heels or sandals 8 wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you dont stab the wrong person 9 always carry your car keys on you 10 put out a camp fire when you go to bed 11 watch your step if you trip on something your going to break a bone 12 check the backseat for uninvited guess 13 if the killer has you cornered at least put up a struggleand guess what at least one but usually all four of the main characters breaks all of these common sense rules they are the dumbest characters ever to grace a filmnow for some brief comments this slasher film was on a very tight budget so low four of the 7 or 8 actors play more than one role the acting writing direction sound lighting camera work plotting editing etc are all bottom of the line but like the classic film jack o this works on a sooooooooo bad it is very entertaining and campy fun level so rent this and have a good time and laugh my rating 5 out of 10,0,0,positive,
i was drawn to this movie the moment i saw a preview of it on oscar night when i read about kay pollak i was hooked we americans are suckers for a comeback kidi understand this movie was a huge draw in sweden as a very provincial american i can only speculate on the reason perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which i believe has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societiesthe message of this movie for me is the same as the movie titanic life is short people and as far as anyone really knows its all weve got it can be taken away at any time so isnt it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because were so afraid of being hurt tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls feeling alive is worth taking the risk give and you will receive so start living nowmany people are criticizing this movie for its lack of characterization and other flaws i say you are all pseudosophisticated get a grip folks its a parable a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject povertyso join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and commune with your fellow man writing a check is not enough we are a social species by the way even the humblest of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought possiblerugged individualism has its place but it is overrated,1,-1,neutral,

pretty good movie about a man and his wife who get caught up in murder and the police officer investigating the case it starts off marvelously but kind of hits a wall at a certain point were sure we know what happened then a tiny plot thread that seems at first like a red herring pops back up and disappoints still clouzots direction is great and the acting is quite good louis jouvet who also costarred in marcel carns drle de drame gives the best performance as the clever detective i wonder if the coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote fargo much like that film the police officer doesnt appear until nearly halfway through and then he becomes almost the focus of the film theres also a lot of droll comedy surrounding him although sometimes his methods seem sort of fascist,1,1,positive,
feh this movie started out in an interesting manner but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull the confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so the dull comes later with a tepid romance between the two living peoplepusses both the vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film which is sad if the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber the movie might have been bettermaybe because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well take on solid human form and most likely start killing off everybody a sort of japanese mystical night of the living dead type thing but this doesnt come to pass even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter no mass rising of the dead no walking army of corpses nothing the priest merely makes the girls spirit go back to the land of the dead taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her as shed crushed his spine like peanut brittleat which point i was tempted to cheer loudly as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the dead girlewwww the robitussen sucking spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time and thats it no real horror no real creepiness which the japanese tend to do far better than american film makers with their emphasis on overthetop cheesy face makeup no screaming mimis i was very disappointed,0,-1,positive,

i wish it were last dumb thriller but thrillers are like that they are like children numerous illogical and often annoying they want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a childs behaviour or a thrillers plot having seen this particular child i mean thriller i understand why reviewers refer to it as a hitchcockian thriller they might as well have called it idiotic for thats what hitchcockian means in the movie dictionary look it up if you dont believe me even the soundtrack is oldschool hollywood which is a mistake it doesnt fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony besides how dare they steal de palmas idea of stealing from hitchcock the story is absurd scheiders wife is killed and her killers are never an issue instead first his former employers follow him around and later decide to kill him why do they decide to kill him no explanation perhaps because the fbi is a dark dark organization xfiles which is very triggerhappy about knocking off its former employees for pensionfunds reasons or perhaps because its fashionable to want to kill scheider in this movie everyone seems to be after him and while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy in reality the killer is janet margolin yes the woman occupying scheiders living quarters the one that briefly hinted she was depraved why does she go after scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid and followed by his own exemployers and not a few years earlier or few years after the wifes murder a pure hitchcockian look it up again in the dictionary in case you forgot what it means coincidence and how about that brilliant motive of hers her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a freshofftheboat 15 yearold virgin in ny and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny jewish men one of whom tahdah is scheiders grandfather as a result margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time among other things in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her oncevirginal grandmother how hitchcockian look it up is that the finale then shamelessly rips off the mount rushmore scene from north by northwest except that the loveinterest is a killer and she doesnt get savedthe movie also offers some dubiousoffkilter dialog and some notso great acting check out the silly and obvious way in which napier follows scheider at the cemetery lets also not forget the moronic plotdevice of napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously but it wasnt a gun how brilliant napier in the tower now theres another string of illogical behavioural patterns j demme was is and always will be a director without style without flair and the man who directed philadelphia lets give him another oscar,0,1,positive,

the threepart series ended last night on pbs which i believe was its first wide exposure to an american audience the richness of its text and the unique quality of its filming are high points it seems very novel to view and hear an action play employing the vernacular of georgian england jane austens filmed drawing rooms being the primary example of that form of speech yet it is the scope of drama overwhelming the senses that makes quaint language fit perfectly into each and every scene such bold exposure to an old reality is evocative of literary giants like tolstoy or shakespeare while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a c s forester or patrick obrian sea saga the universality of basic human condition lies at its centernarrator talbot as played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of benedict cumberbatch surely not even dickens could beat that one alternates between stodgy jingoism and extreme vulnerability an acting tour de force indeed i cannot recall among this very fine cast any misstep of interpretation that is a tribute not only to the actors themselves but to the director as wellthe most impressive element however is how perfectly life aboard a manofwar en route to australia in the early 1800s is presented that is especially true of how the motion of the ship becomes almost a character itself something sea stories rarely take into account except as backdrop anyone who has ever experienced mal de mer in person will recognize it instantly and appreciate all the more how difficult it must have been to recreate within the context of filmingthis is no fanciful pirates of the caribbean some effort must be expended in attaining an understanding of its nuances,1,-1,positive,
not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series i expected this film to merely accomplish the basic introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics present a plot and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel and thats exactly what this movie happens to deliverhowever unlike with most other comic book movies i felt that this one did it with a bit of class risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes blade presents a very modern believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dreadas minor as it may have beenfrom a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional ie sappy aspect is concernedyes the movie has innumerable plotholes and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years but when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this what else matters it may run a little long but for what it sets out to do blade stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre,1,-1,neutral,
when seeing this movie you should take notice to that its not a normal movie it has no real story just characters a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony the dialogue is wonderful you can just lay back and listen the movie stands out thats why its hard to find a right way of describing itthats why the user comments on this movie is so mixedi for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love oneliners and things that differ from the normal you cant really put the finger on whats so wonderful about it its just a comical world where gangsters rule a place of love and danger a movie that you can see more than one time,1,1,positive,
i saw this film at the seattle international film festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and indian expats the film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film the direction is self assured especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts while the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack the soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers if you want to see what can be done in 45 days with a different location every day check out hari om for inspiration it was not disclosed in the q a but i imagine hollywood could take a lesson in budget filmmaking by learning from this director,1,1,positive,
having watched this film years ago it never faded from my memory i always thought this was the finest performance by michelle pfeiffer that ive seen but i am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received after seeing it once more today i still think it is powerful moving and couldnt care less if it is based loosely on king leari now realize that this is the greatest performance by jessica lange that ive ever seen and she has had accolades for much shallower effortsa thousand acres is complex human vibrant and immensely moving but surely doesnt present either of the primary female leads with any touch of glamour or sexiness i dont think this is well received in these timesperhaps one reason for this films underwhelming response lies in the fact that the writer jane smiley screenplay laura jones and director jocelhyn moorehouse are all women i know that in my younger days i wouldnt have read a book written by a woman i didnt focus on this fact until years laterif you havent seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past try watching it anew maybe you are ready for it,1,1,positive,

this is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990s versions but is still not all that good it feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980s period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbeythe length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90s versions and st john rivers is at least covered although not very well timothy dalton is very good as rochester but the actress playing jane is much too old there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it,1,-1,neutral,

a group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butlerthe aristocats is regarded as one of walt disneys finest 2d animations with its charming script and cool characters but it doesnt quite have the magic that created snow white or the jungle bookthe slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment beginthe young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate withnot the funniest disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments especially involving the cats and the dogs the representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusingthe story after the boring beginning is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be there are hardly any lapses and no dull moments the journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring not to mention two very strange british swanswith disney you always get a strong meaningful message with the jungle book it is where you belong with beauty and the beast you explore the importance of inner beauty however with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing the film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough it seems very far fetched and irrelevantmy sister and i found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the jungle book castdespite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to,1,0,positive,

as ive hopped from film to film at the sxsw film festival this film from the opening night has stayed with me curious because it is a dark comedy with quite an absurdist premisea family of hyperstressed fundamentalists in a small community of like minds is changed by an auto accident three of the four have the same neardeath experience in which they are fully opened as each receives a reversal of the concept of original sin i wont spoil this scene with the specifics the fourth a middle school cheerleader is not just the only one physically hurt but also is unchanged and is now witness to what has become her crazy apparently spiritually bankrupt family every new moment brings a new outrageousness as they have become innocently naked and frank in every way horrifying her and then the communityforgiving the franklins has the most beautiful sexual awaking scene between a husband and wife that i have ever seen to the sarah brightman song deliver me a song that can now bring tears to my eyesthe cast is terrific robertson dean as the dad vince pavia as the son and aviva as the cheerleader daughter are excellent mari blackwell plays peggy the moms questioning neighbor and best friend perfectly a much more nuanced fleshed out real character than what might have been everyone in middle america knows a peggy and theresa willis positively glows as betty the mom there are lots of risks taken by the actors playing the three changed characters and these risks pay offi hope this film gets a wide release if so i plan to see it againvery accurate review at httpwwwfosteronfilmcomphilforgivinghtm,1,1,positive,
this film lacked something i couldnt put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors i just dont knowbut could it have been the screenplay just exactly who was the chef in love with he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princessi was disappointed in this movie but dont forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself,0,-1,positive,

notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned its obscurity was its greatest asset it seems hey its often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you cant back the legend up with substancethe film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted while there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses nature documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged beauty and the beast encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her on video i guess you can fastforward thru the banality but its not really worth the effort the nudity doesnt go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertoluccis the dreamerstry as one might to find some moral or symbolism in the carnality i doubt its worthy of anyones effort unfortunately for la bete now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once forbidden has been lifted and this beast has been tamed,0,1,positive,

had this been the original 1914 version of tess of the storm country also starring mary pickford i probably would have rated it a lot higher as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens however by 1922 this film was already starting to show its age and compared to many of ms pickfords other films such as daddy longlegs sparrows my best girl and suds tess comes up a tad shortand not every pickford film merits a 10 even if she was americas sweetheart now this isnt to say that its a bad filmit certainly isnt but i just cant see how so many have given this film a 10the film has a very long and complicated plotespecially because most films of the era were shorter a rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river at the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he cannot evict so he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land one ends up in tragedy when his daughters fianc is killed in a scuffle with the po folks the man accused of the murder is dear old marys father though he is innocent to make things a lot worse the only witness to the real murder wont talk and the dead man had gotten his fiance pregnant so at this point we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her sanctimonious father she is in the family way theres a ton more to the film such as the cranks son falling in love with mary but its best you just see the film for yourselfthe film excels in some ways the plot while very complicated is also rather interesting and the cinematography is topnotch the very final scene is also pretty cute however there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife mary is so good and so sweet and so plucky at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take while it worked great in 1922 making her the biggest star in the world today its very dated this is not true of all her films but this one certainly isby the way the image entertainment dvd is of decent quality though a few scenes are badly degradedsomething that isnt very surprising considering the age of the film also the only extras included are a brief filmography,1,-1,positive,
are we really making video nasties again in the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8mm this is quite a ride unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a travelogue as our heroine searches the sleaze spots of paris hamburg and amsterdam i am however being rather churlish for the depraved scenes including everything from hot wax harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning beheading and some these scenes are immaculate and its a pity bruno and his budget couldnt stretch to make all the many characterful creatures introduced become more than simply caricatures,1,-1,neutral,
and my reasons for which are simple there are so many great films presented and discussed here most of them by their own directors and stars so many clips of infamous moments in 70s movie history and in fact a number of films i have yet to see that it wouldnt be fair to grade this work by this logic i shouldnt have given grades to other movie documentaries like martin scorseses personal journey through american movies and my voyage to italy but while those films were on the basis of one mans view of cinema narrating through most of the way richard lagravanese and the late ted demmes a decade under the influence lets the films and the creators speak entirely for themselves what makes decade worth at least one watch for film buffs or just anyone who likes the films of the late 60s70s in america are the levels that it goes to that in the uncut version three hours not the theatrical version which i have no comment on plenty of ground is covered interviews include the likes of scorsese robert altman sidney lumet julie christie jon voight francis ford coppola paul schrader pam grier bruce dern peter bogdanovich roger corman dennis hopper robert towne etc and theres a constant flow of insight from start to finish the way the clips and directorsactors pop up edited together in a flashy and quick style is also fascinating the one down comment i have on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported on in various books like easy riders raging bulls and though i havent seen the movie version of that book yet im sure it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents as here in fact the book of that is one of the best ive ever read however this documentary serves as something special for film buffs and occasional movie goers of the future they can look at this and learn not only about such well known pictures as easy rider the last picture show annie hall coming home and lessor knowns like scarecrow panic in needle park the landlord joe they shoot horses dont they they can also learn about who influenced them new waves of europe and asia who they served as influences for and how the subject matter that created controversy after controversy still serves as intriguing and chancy material for the contemporary crowd seek this out,1,1,positive,

this is a plot driven movie and extremely entertaining nothing startling or original within the plot but crucially it moves along at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention i didnt really notice the acting which i guess is a good thing john mills was fine but did seem to take everything in his stride somewhat considering how his life was falling apart around him he would be clumped on the head stand up 20 seconds later dust himself down and carry on as if nothing had happened a minor quibble in a film with a strong story authentic locations and a plot that continually keeps you guessing right up to its conclusion,1,1,positive,

the music of albeniz pervades this film once and a while it is played with original instrumentation eg piano but never full orchestra but often it is reworked with various contemporary ensembles egguitar and treatments eg jazz piano only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances often flamenco but not always i would guess that there are 1214 scenes which are not united by a plot not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer in my case about half reached the pinnacle though all the rest were in their own way very fine those that worked for me moved me to gooseflesh aesthetic delight indeed the final scene left me weepy with joy and in some very magical way it brings you deep into spanish culture if you dont like subtitles dont worry the film is virtually wordless though each scene carries a title of an albeniz piece seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the usa i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here european dvds wont play on american dvd players this is a scandal,1,-1,neutral,

the book the railway children is a childrens book published in 1906 by edith nesbit an early british socialist who had very strong views about the importance of family values for the upbringing of children and the story it told was presumably intended to be contemporary somewhat surprisingly it seems to retain a significant appeal for todays children a hundred years latera film adaptation of an edwardian classic childrens story with the principal roles those of the children does not sound very exciting to most filmgoers in this day and age but a really great performance by jenny agutter who near the start of her long and distinguished acting career played the part of the oldest girl roberta bobby combined with remarkable work by the scriptwriter and director lionel jeffries and outstanding photography by arthur ibbetson have made this a film that is still not to be missed and one which most of its viewers find quite memorable it is remarkable that this book set in the year 1905 was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000 four of them by the bbc for british television and all of these versions are not only still greatly admired but also very highly regarded something that user comments on this database will confirm even though this may seem almost inconceivable for a nostalgic period story designed to appeal primarily to children since i have not seen the four bbc tv versions these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 film version produced for showing in cinemas unlike most films of childrens books the railway children may appeal more to adults than to children the structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children may feel totally lost by the way in which it is depicted in the film whereas many older adults may find it has a considerable nostalgic appeal perhaps compensating for this the children featured in the film are full of life and vitality whilst the adult characters although well rounded tend to mostly be stuffed shirts the story is a mature one which deals with love support and encouragement it is not only timeless but capable of appealing to all ages it can fairly be described as sentimental and more than a little idealised but it is never in any way mawkish and that rarely justified adjective uplifting fits it like a glovespoiler aheadthe film starts with its upper middle class edwardian family celebrating christmas in a comfortable and fairly spacious london home when two unexpected visitors call and take father who is a senior government officer away with them mother has to move to a very small cottage alongside the railway in a remote part of yorkshire and the children gradually build a new life mainly associated with the railway and the few trains that pass this life proves quite eventful in small ways and the elder daughter bobby grows up rapidly as she takes over more responsibilities from her mother at one point she averts an accident to the train when her sharp eyes spot that a landslide has created a natural hazard fathers story is never given much emphasis but he is never forgotten and it gradually becomes apparent that he is incarcerated and suspected of treason finally these suspicions are cleared up we are not told how or why and he reappears unexpectedly at the local station to rejoin his familyfor many years this film was not available in any home video format in north america but anchor bay created a dvd from it three years ago so they clearly recognised that this quite simple film has not yet lost its appeal for anyone who has not got one already i would very strongly recommend rushing out to buy a copy of this dvd whilst it is still available you would be most unlikely to be disappointed unless you have become totally cynical or your minimum requirements for a film include buckets of blood andor intense sex scenes,1,1,positive,
i suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early sofia loren film she was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953i viewed this film because i wanted to see some of sofia lorens early work i was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an ethiopian princess surely today this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making it actually became annoying watching ms loren in skin color paint throughout the filmyes this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie then the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent i discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weightas beautiful as ms loren was at age 19 and still is today the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage after all we dont see beautiful young people on stage with old opera singers back stage singing from behind the curtain do not discount the success of using heavyweight opera singers one only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the j g wentworth company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the companys product this is one of the best and entertaining tv commercials produced to datethe quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality the color ink has faded much and that can not be helpedto improve this film on dvd the production company should add english language subtitles so that we who do not speak italian can know what the lyrics are saying it would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the sceneswatch this film not because of the story of aida nor the fact that this is an opera aside from ms sofia loren none of her coactors are known nor remembered by this writer instead watch this movie if you are a fan of ms loren and wish to see her at age 19 no matter what the production islarry from illinois,0,-1,positive,

as was to be expected a mazursky film made in the 70s would be counterculture sympathetic towards the hippies and have a lot of hippies in it and naturally it is childishly antiauthoritarian eg the scene on the mexican border when sutherland provokes a customs officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he sutherland has long hair the constant leftwing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had i not been prepared for it beforehand sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film and most of these ideas are either about blacks or indians needless to say he would be welcomed with open arms in todays hollywood one of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in beverly hills a racewar sotospeak in the middle of la this is the kind of nonsense that mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies fortunately some of sutherlands hippie friends make fun of this blackrevolution premise and the resulting dialogue isnt bad a little later the jewish guy makes a crack about sutherland making a movie about masturbation and the black problem when the latter starts talking about masturbation another funny moment is when sutherlands older daughter performs some pc crap on stage with her white schoolmates and they all say we the black people of the republic of south africathere is always a certain amount of selfindulgence when hollywood makes a movie about hollywood especially when its hollywood making a movie about hollywood discussing hollywood doing movies now thats very very selfindulgent indeed the scene with fellini playing himself is more amusing than annoying though mazursky throws in the standard flowerchildren and antivietnam bullshit into the soup and also pokes fun at corporate hollywood but he wasis just as much a part of the phony hollywood lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment as anyone else i am pretty sure that he too makes phony smalltalk in beverly hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesnt know or like but whose money he wants badly for his next leftwing project as for his hair he has the worst hair ive seen in a very long time on film or elsewhere its sort of like the kind of long hair that a middleaged accountant would have if he grew it long the film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third if youd like to read my parodybiography of donald sutherland and other hollywood actors contact me by email,0,0,negative,

im biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy in my opinion the most romantic country in the world unfortunately the movie was rather short unusually so for a period piece and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect however the excellent story makes up for it the four ladies embark on a muchneeded relaxing vacation with problems on their minds over the course of the movie they realize their problems and begin fixing them they believe san salvatore the castle they stay in has an enchanting effect on people its a tub of love says lottie wilkins you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on themall their problems and their solutions are plausible the actresses were great the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale all in all a 1010 movie for me,1,1,positive,

my only problem with the curse of the wererabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce wallace and gromit to those not familiar with parks short films strangely a close shave manages to do this with a lot less time to spare still i loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters human and otherwise i especially loved ralph fiennes voice as the scheming victor quartermaine it is also interesting to see the series on the large screen the workmanship with the clay characters really stands out its a hoot and great for the whole family i buy very few dvds but i have every wallace and gromit and will happily add this one,1,1,positive,
i originally saw this on its premiere in the uk i was mesmerised by it and it had me in tears all throughout its duration i taped it off the tv for safekeeping but over the years its worn out and tv never seem to show it therefore it was a joy to find out that true movies own the copyright and were showing it on their channels this time i taped it onto a dvd so i can enjoy it again and againlucile fray played magnificently by ann margret discovers she has cancer and that it is terminal her husband has arthritis and although he is loving he is an alcoholic and would be incapable of taking care of their children after she has gone therefore she has to find new homes for each of her children before she diesthe acting is top notch the music beautiful and it has stood the test of time wonderfully it still makes me cry if you ever get the chance you would be silly to miss this it is a wonderful film a must see for everyone,1,1,positive,
this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick carrie and others and barbara bach it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but its worth it this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time it seems that 3 young newswomen karen vicky and jennifer travel to the small city of solvang california to cover a festival when a mixup occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller lassick and his strange wife virginia vickie stays behind feeling ill as the other 2 are off to film their story she is soon murdered at the house in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover jennifer is fighting with her exlover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home her hosts whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son devise a plot to try to murder her as well virgina does not totally agree with earnests plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior here the film turns almost comic as junior portrayed hysterically by stephen furst is a deformed mentally deficient manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though its supposed to be scary this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done the actorsactresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick furst and bach and although its not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining,1,0,positive,
the german regionalbroadcaststation wdr has shown both the general and odc on saturday ive seen the general and i thought it wasnt very bad but not very good too but yesterday ive seen odc and i switched it off after about an hour although kevin spacey was the main actor the movie was totally confusing and seems restless the general told the story straight and ordered but odc just wanted to be cool there is a reference on the guy ritchie movies lock stock and two smoking barrels and snatch but doesnt have the coolness of these moviesso in the end i would rate it 3 of 10,0,0,negative,
i just got home from seeing radio ive not seen such an inspiring story in a long time my kids are ages 8 and 5 and i would like to take them so that they may feel the message as i did you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are not judge them for their differences cuba gooding jr and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie i dont know why we cant have more movies like this rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis,1,-1,positive,
i watched this movie with my mother she is 81 yrsold and was raised to be a bigot she even acknowledges this i dont think she really understood what was happening she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty scary i felt for this child and his family what torture they went through and remained faithful that is true faith back to the movie i was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude i am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case it was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him i could tell when one the cops was lying he would not look the defender in the eyes his eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions it is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin i read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men they were finally found guilty after many years i cant remember the title but it was the same premise whites doing whatever they want with blacks i am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time if not forever i pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white no comment from her i want to commend the director and producer of this film i feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project i am an avid viewer of indy films i feel that they are well written and have substance i am pleased that i happened to grab this movie on the shelf i felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly i feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society,1,-1,negative,
i recently had the pleasure of meeting mr hauer at the 2005 sarasota film festival for the us premier of this film not only was he gracious enough to autograph my copy of blade runner he took the time to answer some questions about the film before screening the room for a packed theatre i was so impressed by the film that i used it as the yardstick by which to compare all other films i had seen at the festival it was powerful and moving yet subtle and brief the film tells the story of how a young man older version played by rutger one day finds himself entranced by a seemingly ordinary room in an unremarkable building near the street walking by he notices a single window always open from which a haunting melody can be heard each day he passes by the room sometimes standing for hours outside watching it through the silken drapes that flutter in the light breeze hoping to get a glimpse of its occupants towards the end of the film we find out how significant this room really is and what has drawn our protagonist to it the film was cut beautifully not a second of screen time was wasted on an uninteresting shot any single frame from the film could stand alone in an art gallery rutger is amazing he is mysterious yet approachable his dialogue encompasses a series of reflections on a life that has run its course for better or worse his words conjure familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience i was particularly moved by a scene in which he is looking at some old photos remembering his favourite dog his favourite horse and his first love you get the feeling that you are in his presence as he allows you into his world to glimpse precious memories of a life that is nearing its endi loved this film and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something fresh intelligent and moving should be required viewing for all film majors,1,1,positive,
many people are making fun out of steven seagals acting abilities and i really see why if i remember fire down below wellok his other films are acceptable regarding to his acting after reading reviews about the patriot i didnt expect anything from this film i barely came through fire down below and i read a lot that the patriot was even worse so i was really surprised about this one in my opinion it is one of his very best movies if it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be the best i liked the story the directing and the actors cammilla belle was just incredible she will have a great moviecareer in the future the few action scenes were very well made and steven seagal was very believable in his unusual role,1,1,positive,
i used this film in a religion class i was teaching the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment a young boy and his mother are away from home the boy has been given money to buy milk on the way home he stops at carnival to play a game next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary the boy drops the bottle of milk it breaks the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk this scene alternates with what is happening at home a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment he discovers the fish bowl and watches it the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl by now a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath the cat drops the fish into the bowl the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat both inspire prejudice both are innocent it was a great discussion starter in my class,1,1,positive,
this wasnt all that great not terrible or hateful or anything just forgettableit had a sort of um hesitant diluted air like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for sweetness or for satire so we were left with weak mix of the three the actors seemed kinda lostalso the ideas were really tired and recycled almost zombified themselves how many more times do we have to be told the 50s in the states were infected with a banal sense of conformity and that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism and that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing old hatits biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was i know it was a comedy and all but especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period you still need some sort of emotional anchor some relatable guide through the story to make it engaging for the hero kid to watch an old woman two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders then i just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way the mum was the same if you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level then you risk losing me and thats what happenedbiggest positive i can offer is that i love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough it was a handsome film especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the robinsons house also the opening newsreel was cute in a beendonebeforebutstillfunny sort of wayand i thought billy connolly was ok and that comes from someone who isnt a big fan of billy connolly movie star i just had this fear he was going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene but he played it pretty lowkey for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole filmall in all not great though,0,-1,positive,
a great slasher movie too bad it was the producers and not part of the script basic plot summary man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as i did and chopped the heck out of the movie nothing flows you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time didnt he off that one earlier and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke not that i can blame him i passed out 23 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist warning when you see the ending do not try to connect it with anything that happens before you will just get an aneurysm not worth the time effort or god forbid money only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 the slim chance that the hacking occurred between film release and the horrible version that i watched,0,0,positive,
another masterpiece that needs a dvd release but some libraries have the vhs and well worth seeking out just a brilliant play about many things foremost being euthanasia respectability religion and fundamental human relationships the script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with an issue like a severely disabled child but to bind the parents in their love for jo and each other as the couple alan bates and janet suzman are perfectly matched both in acting virtuosity and in bringing their deep intelligent characters to lifeive recently seen bates brilliant performance in butley which was released as a film a couple years after joe egg and he plays a teacher in both cynical intellectual and funny although butley is much darker than his character of bry here if you throw in such great performances in the gobetween women in love whistle down the wind the caretaker and georgy girl not to mention the more obvious king of hearts and zorba the greek and id say that alan bates had a career comparable to peter otoole albert finney and the other great british actors of his eradirector peter medak also had one of my alltime favorites the ruling class released the same year 1972 as joe egg which comprises a career year in anybodys book hes had kind of a spotty filmographythe krays was another highlight but these two gems will mark him as a great director,1,1,positive,
i can laugh at just about anything but unfortunately there is not a single one to be found in this stink bombi honestly watched this movie from beginning to end and did not even crack a smile i am shocked that sandler schneider spade etc would put their names on this piece of crap worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst that ever came out of former snl players what more can i say how could such tasteless extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent maybe i have lost my sense of humor not likely but i cannot remember a movie that i have disliked this much in a long time what a waste of 2 hours i will never get back,0,0,negative,

i watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on so many peoples favourite episodes list im not boasting in any way but from the start i realised they were in some sort of toyboxcan with the huge eye looking down on them to the type of characters in there even though throughout the episode the questions of who are we where are we whats outside carry the suspense of the episode which i unfortunately already figured out i must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them did make the episode interesting enough although the twist of the story may have been harder to guess if all of them were toy soldiers,0,-1,neutral,
there is so much that is wrong with this film but to sum it up terrible acting so bad it must have been on purpose poor script they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story ridiculously bad ending in some cases the ending manages to save the filmnot in this case if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for this is the worst film i have seen in a long time it was complete torture sitting through this film i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance so do yourself a favor watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture,0,0,positive,

by many accounts stu ungar was not a very nice guy he spat on dealers stiffed people he owed money to and was verbally abusive many filmmakers might choose to sugarcoat the man making him into some sports hero that would triumph despite adversity but high roller doesnt do that and thats a tough row to hoeinstead we have to look very closely to see a man that never matured passed the frightened little boy from the streets of new york despite all his successes and the only real approval he ever gets is from death himself very brave because people wont get it and very touching when you dowhat is also brave is the use of a scorsese feel aha how derivative people will say really but theres virtually no violence and stuey loved gangster movies maybe the feel reflects the man stu and not the director marty and if it really is a low budget film and looks that good bravofinally the linear flashback structure wow will that get hammered yet not only does it work it works exceptionally well even for those who dont see the connection to the seventh seal proof in ss knight plays game of chess with death in hr stuey says we can play a hand of cards for ya know death says never much good at cards damn great last lineno tricky effects or camera moves no shaky camera nothing trendy at all just solid tight storytellingmaybe that makes the movie too basic and somehow flawed but then again so was the guy and that makes it just about right910,1,1,positive,
tonights film course film was the legend of the suram fortress and during its 87 minute running time it managed to quickly jump into my top five most difficult films of all time thats difficult to watch films so different to everything else that youre seeing something totally alien a brief synopsis would be a group of georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from invaders but every time they are about to put on the finishing touches for no readily apparent reasons it collapses so they go and see a fortune teller who advises them that if they want to get the fortress to stay standing they need to find a youth a tall blonde blue eyed boy to be buried into one of the walls during the construction and his presence will ensure that the construction job will be completed smoothly and sure enough in those closing moments there he is gladly being smeared in cement and eggs giggling as hes buried alive with only his mother to grieveit actually a fairly simple story but the director sergo paradjanov working in soviet georgia in 1984 not too long after leaving a fifteen year jail term doesnt follow any of the film making rules we are used to there are very few close ups very often the action we need to be following is hidden in the bottom left hand corner of a landscape shot extraordinarily easy to miss there are very few close ups and at times its hard to tell whose doing what to whom and why every now and then the film goes off on digressions which have no relevance to the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer the music is utterly mad with found sounds on screen instruments and church organ dropped in seemingly at random at times when nothing seems to be happening someone will break into a jig almost playing time until the next scene comes along but infuriatingly there is an obvious cinematic voice behind it all so youre compelled to try and understand the message whatever it is one of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you cant believe what youre seeing,0,-1,negative,
the tv productions at the 2000s start were between weak and bad before marks like alias lost prison break desperate housewives or monk the tv didnt have the right hit yet which could capture the attention and the interests of the 2000s viewer titles like relic hunter mutant x the lost world sheena or even baywatch hawaii werent encouraging for you to watch and follow or at least werent that captivating and interesting all the time as what preceded them special unit 2 was no exception in fact its men in black meets the x files spoof as if these were the special unit 1 but even according to this brilliant formula it didnt work well it was promising at the time there was some saturation out of the supernatural cases after a decade of many x files already so the natural spirit to lampoon it naughtily too imagine mulder as womanizer however special unit 2 wasnt the strongest in this or a strong when it comes to make a comic scifi show it was highly ridiculous where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one it enjoyed that bad taste sickeningly michael landes was noncharismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian his chemistry with alexondra lee as well as any supposed sexual attention was all languid sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work its clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea among evan katzs other works as a cowriter and a coproducer like seven days before or 24 later this must be a low point despite the distinctive personality it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time therefore if that was there goal so they made one of the silliest indeed and truly it would be one of the rarest times to be thankful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it only,0,-1,positive,

this is my favorite movie that portrays african americans in whole different light because it shows a different side of african americans that it is not shown in the movies its not the gang bang urban ghetto setting or having to deal with deep racial issues it captivates the whole essence of being young and trying to be successful and having problems with letting your guard down and letting someone into your life and the whole bohemian atmosphere gives that great touch that makes all that great its a great script great dialoge that captivates you and you just get involved with the character perfect casting with a lot of chemistry and very good acting and i still havent seen any other movie with black characters that are portrayed in this format the only one that get close is sprung but since its a comedy it looses it very quickly i give this movie 9 out of 10 and i wish they would keep making movies with this type of attitude about african americans,1,1,positive,
i can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst laurel hardys for me it isnt as close to as bad as air raid wardens and the bullfighters but there are some definite huge flaws in it the film is set up to show laurel and hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a london bridge dance surrounded by 20th century fox starlets while in the next room laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit a clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor leading to a predicable gag where hardy ends up the looser then in come the racketeers now selling insurance covering up their protection racket one of them is a very young and handsome robert mitchum but no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance they are arrestedthis is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio the rest of the film is devoted to laurel and hardys support of wealthy patron trudy marshall and her inventor boyfriend robert bailey they first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents matt briggs and margaret dumont and hopeful suitor allan lane whom we can tell right off is a nogood swine this leads to briggs hidden bar being revealed to teatotaling dumont and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below when bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun pandemonium ensues the deadpan butler announces to case and dumont that their house is on firelater hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get laurel to break a leg to do so there is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman after being arrested their licenses would have been revoked laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog only a frosting covered cake devouring toto lookalike or possibly the actual pooch causing oliver to end up on a huge beach rollercoaster that somehow the bus has ended up on perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks rollercoaster gags can be exciting as evidenced in abbott and costello go to hollywood and this one is amusing but anticlimacticas the story wraps up all of these gags seem to have no point giving the impression that this was simply a series of onereelers put together to make a fulllength feature hopefully part of a double bill lh as ive mentioned in other reviews of their later films had lost much of their luster after leaving hal roachs employ but surprisingly here they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year had the gags not been as amusing as was the case with some of their other films this surely would have ranked a 2 as opposed to a 3,0,0,positive,

watching floored by love one thought comes almost immediately to mind my god this looks like a really bad sitcom sure enough it turns out that fbl is a pilot for a series that may start this fall in canada poor poor canadacara shirley ng and janet natalie sky are a lesbian couple living in vancouver janet has come out to her mother already but caras parents are still in the dark about their daughters homosexuality the pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from malaysia for her younger brothers wedding that same week british columbia legalizes gay marriage with janet wanting to wed cara has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative chinese parents thats shes gay will she would she could she caras situation is contrasted with that of jesse trent millar jesse has just declared his homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen his biological father daniel andrew mcilroy is coming for a visit soon his stepfather norman michael robinson fears that his chances of finally being fully accepted by jesse are harmed by the fact that daniel is gay and he is not will dialing 1800makeover helpthe dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser 1950s program along with the overdone physical emoting the full housestyle melodrama is enough to make you wince from time to time and the attempts at comedy largely fail mcilroy millar sky are the only performers that approach competency in this miscalculation but given the material they have to work with its no surprise that none impress its possible that the campiness was purposeful it often seems like there is no way the performers are really that bad that they must be trying to mimic the inferior sitcoms of days yore if this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten the rewrite would focus on floored by love being a poor and ineffective sendup of old sitcomswriterdirector desiree lim has put together a bythenumbers blandfest thats entirely forgettable there was a time when merely having an openly homosexual protagonist was enough to make a mark on the screen that time is gone in this day we need quality as well,0,0,positive,

due to this show getting cut early i never realized why until i recently read the story behind the series i felt this show never got its dues as one of the greatest shows this show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie it was always intended to have if not with the original a team cast at least with the cast incorporated into the story line or a lengthy cameo perhaps at the end commemorate it to the late col hanibal smithpreppard this cast gave so much to bring happiness to us growing up they deserve one last heave ho the fact that the series ended openly because they slashed the series is reason enough this crew and cast made us realize as children the essence of being one of the good guys especially seeing how screwed up the world is today i think a milder version like the original should be put into motion i have already read the previews and i know these are not the plans but if anything a straight to dvd movie i sure would buy it i really do not get how crappy shows get series finales but this great show which still runs regularly today and probably gets watched more than some of the current garbage shows of today dont we will always remember the incredible hulk series knight rider airwolf and the a team because those kind of shows carry through time i am almost positive these knew ones you see about detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years so why not bring back something and show the people what staying power is all about and how these old shows really are all about,1,1,positive,

i watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny but you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced they make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art this is funny at times but annoying for the most part and to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized a majority of the events depicted one of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the power grid very impressive but this is just one example and for what its worth the music sucks the acting sucks the two cute girls are annoying the obnoxious guy is annoying the socalled handsome lead man is a geek and the black girl who fall for him is a fool her father is the worst actor i have ever seen i am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience,0,0,negative,

for some inexplicable reason jerrys movies often seemed to come in for diatribes from certain quarters although they were rarely box office disappointments its one of lifes great mysteries to me because his films have always had a feel good factor about them for me but this film is not only not bad its an exceedingly good and clever comedy to those who may be tickled by modern crude or cruel humour dont see this film theres nothing in it like that and youll be wasting your timeive only seen this film once on the television ive waited ever since to see it again and thats been quite a few years youd think the idea of an arrogant millionaire businessman heading off to win the war against the nazis with his own small private army of subservient employees would be boring wouldnt you well only jerry lewis would dare try such a plot for an out and out comedy and it works i have to say brilliantlyi think that as with the nutty professor and most of his other films this movie is testimony to his comic genius both in concept and execution i think buddy love might have said you know true comedy can not only make a six year old hysterical itll do that for his dad too maybe a few nutty nazis generals with monocles and a limp would dislike this movie honestly if you only see one more comedy in your life see this one be careful though you might die laughing and im not joking,1,-1,positive,
the only conceivable flaw of this film is its title please stop comparing it to the first i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you havent seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this is a great exponent of screwy mid80s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom 100 is because of its title i usually hate movies like these ie adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically i dunno maybe its like a bad relationship i cant get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind the stunt manrobert stack we love you 19192003,1,-1,positive,

absolutely dreadful mexican film supposedly based on a short story by edgar allan poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works etc when our hero gaston is given the grand show by dr maillard head of the asylum we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific such as men hanging around long in a dungeon and comedic such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both a human man dressed as a chicken yes thats right a chicken that pecks around the ground for chicken feed the scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film but at least for me it was the films low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining ah that is indeed the real horror that is dr tarr and his legion of name changes and that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem yes this is obvious but some have distribution problems and others of which this is one have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once this is definitely garbage it has very little going for it the only performer worth having a look at is claudio brook as the head of the asylum he is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally bellows orders sashays with sword in hand and praises the chicken i got so tired of hearing him talk about the soothing system as his means to cure the mentally sick what a bunch of ludicrosityhey a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word it wont take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting cinematic chicken scratch,0,-1,neutral,

the martial arts movies got huge in the 60s in parts of asia but with the growing popularity of the infamous shaw brothers films america was bound to catch on this movie was the first to be presented in america under the warner bros label and it did in fact start a craze here that flooded the 70s with martial arts films many of the films to follow would pale in comparison but some were great and many like enter the dragon which came out shortly after this one became huge success stories and made superstars out of these fightersfast forward almost 40 years later and this movie still holds up most shaw brothers films are as good today as they were back then and truth be told no films have been made in this genre to compete with those made by the shaw bros back in the dayi like to think martial arts are like porn and nobody watches porn for the plot just the action well same goes with ma films and most of them are just a bunch of great fights with little story this one is an exception it doesnt have an amazing story but there is one therethe main guy played by lo lieh actually stands out amongst karate film heroes he never brags and he never fights just because he can he is often seen as weak and less of a fighter than most but when he must fight he is damn well the greatest alive i really loved this character many of the bad guys were memorable and the fight scenes were just presented so amazingly even a small role with bolo yeung can be seen as the huge mongolian and bolo is in my top 5 as greatest martial artist film stars ever he was also in the above mentioned enter the dragonthe production as ive said over and over is wonderful you cant beat the shaws the direction was something unlike i have seen much in films of the 70s the use of color was well placed and made this movie stand alone and rise above the others when the light shines on chi haos hands as he does the iron fist its pure beautythe music was superb as well martial arts films were to asia what westerns were to italy two separate art forms with so much in common the countries making these films had all genres but the japanese films were what was making waves there as the spaghetti westerns were in italy with their many differences the styles of these two genres were neck and neck as seen in movies like 5 fingers of death the fights were easily compared to sergia leoni cowboy stand offs and the music tied the genres together so well the music here borrowed a little from ironside but it was still very originalmany films were inspired by this one and when i watch it i can see everything from the master killer to bloodsport having been influenced the most obvious movie to have been influenced was kill bill which to me is the greatest of all time many of the sets quentin used are complete replicas of ones seen here and he used the music from this film even though the music he used was the music borrowed from ironside and the fight scene at the end of kill bill vol 1 with the bride and oren is at times exact in comparison to the fight with chi hao and the japanese thug at the end of this moviei have seen many martial arts films a few even better but this is a mustsee for fans of the genre you cant go wrong here the movie starts off slow but 1520 minutes into it it picks up and doesnt slow down,1,1,positive,

in 1993 the visitors was an enormous hit in france so the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made this is a movie that doesnt keep its promises indeed its supposed to tell a sole story jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard instead of this the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot as a consequence the movie becomes sometimes muddleheaded sometimes a bit of a messbut the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie theyre going over the top and become annoying then why did jeanmarie poir the filmmaker engage muriel robin in the female main role he made a mistake because she seems illatease and is absolutely pitiful the other actors arent better marieanne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau unbearable of course the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness certain sequences and dialogs are affected it also appears hollow because poir takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie thus a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her weddinga labored and disappointing followup anyway whats the interest of this movie otherwise commercial,0,0,negative,

in strangers on a train its obvious from the start that playboy wastrel robert walker has singled out farley granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders grangers a semipublic figure hes a tennis pro but not an especially high one high enough however for him to know that granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry ruth romanso when they meet as complete strangers on a train one afternoon walker knows enough that granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them complete strangers did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise though granger is repulsed by the idea one of the beautiful things about this film is that you can see in the performance he gives that granger just might submit to temptationin fact when walker kills laura elliot grangers wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man he expects that granger will in turn murder walkers father so that walker can inherit his estate today walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at thatalfred hitchcock directed walker to his career role ironically in his last complete film walker died the following year with most of my son john finished hitchcock does not do too bad by farley granger either of course when granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him the tension strangers on a train is also characterized by great editing first in the tennis match in which granger has to finish the match and waylay walker before he plants evidence convicting granger at the crime scene and also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between walker and grangerstrangers on a train is hitchcock at his best it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing,1,-1,positive,

if you want to see a brilliant performance of mikado played to perfection with expert timing and panache dont watch this version if you want to see a hammy version with eric idle strutting around in 1930s english gentlemens private club society this is the one to watch its a lot of fun and a good intro to gilbert and sullivan but after this rush out and rent the canadian stratford version youll see the difference between good and great nobody does gs better than brian mcdonald and the stratford group,1,1,positive,

society heiress susan fletcher hopkins and her wealthy father simon fletcher henry stephenson are vexed that their young nieces joan betty philson and katie marianna strelby are living a bohemian lifestyle in greenwich village with their artist uncle john milland after the death of their parents susans sister and johns brother simon has given up trying to convince john to allow he and susan to take care of the children and have resorted to using private detectives to catch him in either unbecoming behavior or unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to greenwich village herself posing as an actress to try to gain information andor persuade him to see reason what she discovers however is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle john and his friends are living and that the girls are being brought up well but that she is quickly falling in love with john inevitably her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whomi really enjoyed this film and found that its very short running time 70 minutes was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story miriam hopkins one of the great 1930s1940s actresses is delightful in this film her energy style and wholesome beauty really lend themselves to creating an endearing character even though you know that shes pulling a fast one on the people she quickly befriends this is the earliest film ive seen ray milland in and he was actually young and nonpatrician looking and apparently three years younger than his costar his energy and carefree manner in wise girl were a refreshing change to the demeanor he affects in his usual darker films honestly though i am usually not remotely a fan of child actors i really enjoyed the two young girls who played susans nieces they were endearingly precocious and were really the jewels of the film unfortunately i cant dig up any other films that either of them were subsequently in after this one which is a shame since both exhibited a large amount of natural talentwise girl was a film that was made three years after the hollywood code was instated and to some extent this was abundantly clear by the quick happy ending and the pie in the sky loftiness and ease with which the characters lived the alleged bohemian coop was in fact a gorgeous culdesac where the artists lived for free or for trade and everything is tied up very nicely throughout fortunately this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make allowances for its fluffiness and shortcomings and i was able to just take wise girl for what it was a good oldfashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing unfortunately films of the romantic comedydrama genre today are considerably less intelligent and entertaining or i wouldnt find myself continuously returning to the classics 710,1,1,positive,
saw this flick on encw last nite for the third or fourth time enjoyed it so much i ordered the dvd this really is a standout and of course the first of the mannstewart pairings more here than the usual oater although not quite as powerful as the searchers lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly its the acting by stewart his partner millard mitchell shelly winters and the waco johnny dean dan duryea steve miller not the joker is interesting as a handsome would be hero whos interested in lola but too yellow like stewart in the man who killed liberty valance hes practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving his enemies coffee decaf no doubt tony curtis from the bronx cavalry and rock hudson behaving like no indian ive seen on screen have interesting cameosspecial performances by john mcintire as a too lucky card dealinggun trader who hangs out at a very low grade western version of ricks american cafe nobody wants to spend the night there jay c flippens out over a kiss from lola winters and has some nice scenes with stewart before he gets to bend of the river and far country will geer as wyatt earp and the indian chief who takes walter brennans teeth from him in red river are pleasant sightings this is the kind of western that only stewart not wayne nor scott could have pulled off worth the shot i repeat,1,-1,positive,
knute rockne all american the biopic about the famous notre dame beloved coach knute rockne is an excellent sports film to watch not ever having seen it we were surprised by the technique used in the movie by director lloyd bacon who shows he was ahead of his times in photographing football games the result is a vibrant picture about the man responsible for the legacy of the collegian sport knute rocknethe film presents rockne from his humble origins in chicago to his studies in famed notre dame university in south bend indiana he was an ambitious man who had a vision about how the game should be played luckily he went to give his beloved notre dame the glory he was afterpat obrien looks a bit older when he starts as a freshman in fact he doesnt change much throughout the film but he is fine as mr rockne pat obrien shows he could inspire the players under him by just being a father figure gale page plays bonnie rockne the wise woman who understood her husbands call in life ronald reagan plays george the gipper gipp who was a legend that died much too young but who left a legacy behind donald crisp makes a good contribution as father john callahan who was rocknes mentor at the universitythis film will delight not only sports because of lloyd bacons direction and the fast pace he gives to the movie,1,1,positive,

this isnt exactly a complicated story its not a mystery or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you to get it may apply to a very few films however this isnt one of them those type of movies have substance and are so involving its easy to miss an important portion of dialog or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked with goyas ghosts this doesnt apply the main flaw in this movie is an absence of detail it jumps from one character to the next never giving enough substance to any one set of scenes to allow the involvement of those watching because of that you dont connect with any of the characters you dont get to the point where you care either the main actor is gone just as the movie seems its going to redeem itself or their actions are despicable and youre not inclined to anyway goyas refusal to go very far to help ines is a good example his refusal to commit himself further mirrors the overall tone of his part the only characters you may momentarily feel for are ines when shes being questioned and then tortured after her rape by lorenzo any focus on her character is pretty much gone following that the only other in depth involvement comes from the best scenes in the movie centered around lorenzos invitation to supper with ines family and her fathers all out attempt to force lorenzo into signing a bogus confession and getting his daughter back then just as things start to be developing again theyre gone from the movie ive read a lot of the comments here about how the movie didnt know what it wanted to be etc i found that basically it succeeded in not being much of anything from lorenzos return and the coincidental viewing of ines daughter by goya everything seemed nothing more than contrived without much of a storyline no effort to really examine the turbulent times they lived in took place the essence of who goya was didnt materialize other than his actions or lack thereof proving him to be more selfcentered than anything else as for his art the movie seemed intent on examining a few of the paintings he did but again frittered away another opportunity in examining the reactions to this work rather than the work itself to sum things up best the movie had no cohesion it grossly lacked the substance to delve into the historical environment it covered and upon ending left you feeling like what youd just seen was a series of aborted attempts to engage the viewer by switching from one thing to the next without adequately engaging the viewer in any of them you cant watch something like this several times expecting it to improve with added examination theres just not enough to it to waste the time its not a case of your missing out on something it would just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good just arent there as for best film ever made its not even the best film ive watched today,0,-1,positive,
while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the sledgehammerobvious satire homecoming hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release fahrenheit 911 before the 2004 elections and the real tragedy of dantes film is that it didnt come out 2 years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further in 2006 mockery of the wellsettled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or imperiled as it did thenfrankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence and if you didnt notice michael moore didnt exactly help to defeat bushthere was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies,0,0,negative,

absolutely one of the worst movies of the year the plot is ridiculous the characters poorly developed and the premise irritatingly stupid it all begins when michael keaton fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since batman loses his beautiful author wife anna to a car accident possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible vw bugs even though shes supposed to be rich in his grief batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby recording nothing and then watching it he learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his tv pretty soon he starts to see dead people thanks to evp or electronic voice phenomenon which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders video cameras dead cell phones anna cell calling but shesdeadmust be ghosts mhmmm no other possible explanation id better start messing around with this indiscriminately etc why they cant just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained anyway eventually batman discovers that hes actually seeing the future and he decides to go help this woman he doesnt know he gets out of his house just in the nick of time because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves dmn it can travel between the living and dead using electronics but ill be dmned if we can be on time am i right guys they nod in bemused agreement he tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie look hard or youll miss him is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons who in raiders of the lost ark style swoop down and kill him looking like the cartoons that they are just then some detectives show up and save the lady after batmans funeral he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of evp is to expose him to it the little kid just smiles nothing phases that dude not even when his dad batman of course starts talking to tvs the highpoint of the movie was when someones phone rang and some guy yelled out its anna,0,0,positive,

with lots of sunshine gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms tracking shots moving through crowds with handheld camera quickpaced editing and extreme closeups here and there the photography is the thing in this interesting artistically done filmthe plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool where we meet the lovely lucienne aka lulu played by louise brooks a bit of a showoff in front of the gawking men by poolside she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest much to the chagrin of her very jealous stickinthemud fianc a pretty annoying fellow really strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause i was wondering couldnt the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time and thus applause on the catwalk lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a maharaja but her hotheaded beau doesnt like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public for that matter i guess he just wants her in his house cooking his meals and staying out of sight ehlouise brooks is beautiful and charming her presence helps enhance this film but its really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound which is a bit off the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually and i found the movie to be excellent well worth seeing,1,1,positive,

dont get fooled with all the big names like burt reynoldsjames woods and anne archer they are just glorified extras their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so whatever their motives for being in this movie if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through the plot itself wasnt that bad and the acting from most of the actors was above average cuba gooding jr however was terrible he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes and since this was meant as a serious movie that cant be a good thing the action scenes were not badbut they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting again better direction was needed also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action for an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow the only redeeming factor is angie harmon she does her best to make it all work too bad the director left her hanging yesthis movie could have been much better with a great director andy cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off and for an actionstunt coordinator of his caliber youd expect at least more exciting action scenes dont waste your time with this one avoid,0,0,positive,

its almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of three colors red without letting people in on some of the ideas that krysztoff kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy the more i see them and think of them and imagine myself in their world the more i get its theme that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion in blue juliette binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected in white an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will against the odds conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle and now in red all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other peoples livesthis young girl is appropriately named valentine a luminous irene jacob who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway not that she is without some baggage she has a boyfriend unseen who also demands to know what she is doing at all times she has a brother who troubles her and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard she strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health but when she takes her to the owner a retired judge jean louis trintingnant he does not want her i want nothing he coldly says and elements of blue suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man who also lives in anonymity and apparent freefloating freedom conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people this male version of juliette binoches character at first shocks valentine she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror but a chance event has her back at his place and here is when he begins revealing who he is and his great lossat the same time kieszlowski is unfolding a parallel story the story of a young man auguste jean pierre lorit about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from valentine but they keep missing each other chance is the word like valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits elements of chance pepper her life and augustes he has a girlfriend who also supplies people with telephoned reports about the weather one of them happens to be the old judge he knows more about her than auguste does and hes never met her like god or prospero he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression we meet again its this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes red so beautiful and transcendent because time is in reality a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it there are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames so many things would be differentsuch is the case with valentine and the old judge i believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond she is that woman whom he did not meet by chance or not and is whether he knows it or not trying to make amends hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the social outcast but it doesnt end there one of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container where julie did not see her and would not have helped her anyhow and karol fresh from his public humiliation sneers at her thinking someone is worse off than i am valentine is the one who helps her frailty in need can happen anywhere and kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor characternow red is so much more than a story valentine the old judge auguste even rita the dog these arent characters confined by storytelling an american version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbeddown ending red is so devoid of a linear defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and placeadding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal this is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films in blue julies husband had a mistress and she also betrays olivier when its become clear shes emotionally dead in white dominique has karol listen to her moan over the phone which becomes an important device in red as she has sex with a man while the billboard of brigite

i saw the movie while i was in a class a few years back in high school i thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles i think the type of people that wouldnt like this movie would be those who dont like solving things or those who get frustrated when they cant solve riddles its a good movie based on a true story that happened in my home town of toronto ontario so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there watch this movie and for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws realize that in real life this same stuff does happen but thats all i want to say on that the riddles are good some are hard some are not but the movie also leaves you wanting more more riddles more explanation just plainly more something more i want to add is that the ideas within this movie the underground riddle world does exist but there is a lot more to it to find it you can not look for it to never look for it would be no way to find it leave your mark and it will find you,1,-1,neutral,
this wonderful movie really takes the time to step back and tell the story without words the end of the movie contains almost no dialogue but what is in the minds of the characters is always perfectly clear you know the film is not going to have a happy ending but you leave the film feeling hopeful,1,1,positive,
we found this movie nearly impossible to watch with such a super cast its a shame that the writing and direction were so awful the excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening the flashbacks were clumsy the characters were onedimensional the heavyhanded metaphors the river the cat were repeated way too often the movie nobodys fool based on another novel by russo was infinitely better probably because it was more tightly written and directed the photography in empire falls was lovely too bad it wasnt a traveloguei read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself i would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novels reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie this was supposed to be a television movie guys not books on tape,0,0,positive,
it seems on the surface to be a romantic planes trains and automobiles but at times tried for something more where it failed miserably some may like the nontraditional ending but the attempts at deep insight into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywherebut if you were interested by the story the movie tried other methods to distract you the unnecessary special effects of which the falling rain was the most obvious served to do nothing but annoy the camerawork is erratic at bestone note of caution however my movie experience as a whole was less than satisfying sitting in the first row with a group of younguns around,0,-1,positive,
i was giddy with girlishglee when i found out about this movie shortly after seeing spirits withinafter years of anticipation they gave november 2005 release date well november came and went followed by december oh look todays january 31 2006 no us release as of yetoh well im so glad i had a friend with a bootlegged subtitled copy dwell the cg was great not as good as expected but near perfect i cringed however at the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the movie i had thought that we were passed this by now also i didnt really care for the anime look given to their faces i was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film and yet most of the characters have largerthannorm eyes especially the girl characters they had personality though ill give them thateven though im not a big fan of anime i do have to say i was impressed with the wild fight scenes they were animated beautifully and had me hanging onto the edge of my seatfor about the first twoand therein lies advent childrens biggest flaw its mostly just a bunch of hyperstylized fight scenesa ff7 sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years instead they gave us a pretty piece of cg with barely a plot to excuse its justundertwohours running timewhere final fantasy is famous for its intricate stories this movie falls short you dont really get to know the characters the only way youd have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game we barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threatwhat hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of ff7 characters were given they were nothing more than clouds ill call if i need you but i probably wont back up singers and to add to the hurt they had each character individually throw cloud higher and higher this little part here was so cheesy i almost turned it off i would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own ricocheting off of walls to get himself up higherit hurt even more when they reduced the turks to lessthanjust comic relief that was fine for the game but this is cinema people do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle they took away their dignity and spoiler yeah right most of you probably already know anyhow who remembers darth maul being hyped up in sw episode 1 yeah now picture that but with sephiroth thats right he had maybe 5 minutes of screen time maybe that end spoiler pif this movie was made for the fans then way to go square if this is any indication of the direction youre taking the ff series i doubt youre going to be seeing much of my money i played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent charactersyou had a chance to make something epic something truly beautiful a masterpiece that flies in the face of all of the disney cg filmsinstead you gave us a pretty piece of flesh with hardly anything underneath to hold it together way to goand im sure if the rest of the fans paused for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything but the cg theyd know what im talking about well i was gonna rate this a 510 but after thinking about it while righting this im giving it a 310 because they could have done better they have done better and this is just sadif theyre gonna remake anything ffvii they need to do this one first,0,1,positive,
elia kazan one of the best theater directors this country ever had showed he was equally at home with movies with panic in the streets mr kazan gives us an early version of what would come later with perhaps his master piece on the waterfront although both movies share only the water setting for they are different visions about different subjectsmr kazan shot on location in new orleans the adaptation by daniel fuchs of the edna and edward anhalt stories that are the basis of the film is remarkable in that it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting the big easy one of the big assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography by joseph macdonald that shows new orleans at its best also the music by alfred newman and the song by billie holiday gives the proceedings a nice touchthis film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the countryone thing comes clear in the movie jack palance making his screen debut smolders the screen every time one sees him he was so intense at the same time this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner who unknown to him is stricken with a fatal disease blackie comforts this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying mans greasy hair with abandon notable also was the fact that mr palance and mr mostel appear to have been doing their own stunts something so refreshing because both actors make it seem realthe film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the reed family at the beginning of the film we see a family man painting furniture with his young son later he and the wife discuss how it appears they cant make ends meet with his salary something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis richard widmark playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people barbara bel geddes as the wife sounds as though shes a suburban woman from connecticutthe film is enjoyable thanks to mr kazans direction and the excellent cast working in the movie,1,1,positive,

a pretty awful film im amazed the likes of derek jacobi vanessa redgrave agreed to be in it its like an overlong episode from a poor tv detective series the biggest flaw has to be vinnie jones he simply cant act whoever had the bright idea of casting him as a leading man wants their head examining unless he put his own money into the project he should stick to playing thugs looking menacing not speaking also was central heating around in dickens times as there were three big radiators behind his deskno wonder they gave this away free with a newspaper as no one would pay to see it,0,0,negative,
i thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoymentrupert grint played the part marvelously and has a general knack for the acting business the almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot and was a character one could almost instantly loathe this reminded me in a way of the divine secrets of the yaya sisterhood not by means of actual content of the film but the premises and overall tone to the film itself driving lessons is a coming of age story which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother the lack of freedom and the discovery of oneself,1,1,positive,
wow just wow there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own i agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing whoo boy does it ever however i think there is some other problems here1 why is christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive the film acts as though you just cant be a christian and also allow for the possibility why they eversobriefly touch on this in the film ie the bible doesnt say there is aliens well the bible doesnt say there isnt but the actual rebuttal is never answered the bible really doesnt say there isnt so how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand or better yet acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite god there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them2 how come the only two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax what about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences what if its something else entirely too bad the film makers already have their minds made up3 the film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult thats a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present im not necessarily arguing that they dont but if youre going to say something so asinine youd better have the facts to back it up4 why does the other reporter not the greasy haired blonde guy the other one always have his hands in his pockets its hard to take someone seriously when theyre constantly playing pocket pooli wish this had been an exploration of christian faith and ufo phenomena but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their faith message to care much about make a thought provoking movie as a christian myself this saddens me,0,0,negative,
want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentlemans club thats what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen but every time i was ready to switch the channel theyd add another scene with the workout girls and id stay put as a slasher film killer workout fails in every category i can think of as a showcase for beautiful girls working out it is a success strong recommendation to avoid unless the thought of half the film being a big ta show appeals to you,0,0,positive,
back in 1994 i had a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation weekends and the holiday itself i stayed in town during that time hanging out at my parents house a loti didnt have a tv in my apartment so i used to watch my parents tube i had just finished watching a segment of the x files when a program came on called personal fx i was hooked instantly i had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents family homes and through inheritances from relatives estates and often wondered about their history value etcafter my long vacation i used to go to my folks house on my lunchhours just to catch personal fxi can remember one episode during which cohost claire carter announced that the new york apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that personl fx would return to the airit never did personal fx was the first and best of the collectible shows and it vanished from the air almost fifteen years later im still soreway to go fx,1,-1,positive,
ill admit that this isnt a great film it practically screams lowbudget yet oddly i still found myself liking the film because although it lacked quality it abounded with energy it was like the little engine that could and a movie merged into one the film takes place at a radio network and concerns some of their lowlevel employeestwo page boys one very pushy and brash and the other one a wuss as well as a new receptionist all three have visions of radio stardom but must for now content themselves with their lowly jobsinto this story appears a murder that seems somewhat out of the blue i didnt know that this was a murder mystery film and was taken a bit by surprise however like most bmysteries the cops are lamebrains and its up to our pushy hero moran to try to save the day throughout all this i had a hard time deciding if moran was obnoxious or endearing im still not sure there is a moment in the film that is high on the cringe factor and that is when the two pages try out for the roles of radio comedians they show up in blackface and do a 3rd or 4th rate imitation of amos n andy apart from being very insensitive it also wasnt funny fortunately the producer of the show they were trying out for seemed to feel the same wayoverall its easy to skip this film and i wouldnt blame you if you do however the weird and frenetic pace of the film actually seemed to make up for the artistic deficiencies of the film and i am glad i saw it a good film no but one that is still worth a peek for fans of old bsby the way perhaps i just dont have very good taste but i thought both female singing divas really had poor voices despite how everyone in the film is captivated by their warblings listen for yourself and let me know what you think i just couldnt believe either was allowed to sing on filmeven if it was just for lowly monogram studios,0,-1,positive,
this first installment of crispin glovers personal magnum opus asks you to think a little and so cant be recommended for any viewer who doesnt want to sit and puzzle over glovers imagery or follow the surprisingly simplebut weirdly obfuscatedthread of his narrative to the more casual viewer yes its probably going to come off as a confusing mishmash of odd startling and disturbing imagery for imagerys sake you get the sense that glover doesnt mind that this is the case and hell almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it glovers innate eagerness for and about his work and how audiences interpret it is strongly communicated not only through the film itself but also through the unusual question and answer sessions that he frequently conducts following showings he clearly hopes that people will continue to think about what he has presentedthe easiest way to interpret and dismiss the film is to label it as dada or nihilist a juvenile attack on the modern movie industry from an actor whos worked both without and within but theres a reason why glover performs his slideshow before showing his movie and its not only to sell books his books juxtapose and create a narrative from images and text that glover pieced together and what is it does similarly with imagery drawn from western culture what is it is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing much has already been made about glovers use of actors with downs syndrome and indeed that is one of the most initially striking aspects of the film so jarring in fact that many seem to interpret it as some sort of farreaching crusade to see a more realistic andor dignified portrayal of the disabled in movies and televisionor on the absolute other end of the spectrum as a kind of direct exploitation of the disabled but its not either and maybe thats part of what makes this film so uncomfortable for many the underlying agenda is not a political one or one of hatred but one of looking beyond the mainstream culture into a kind of outsider ugliness its not a film about downs syndrome but it is a film that is owned by the actors with downs syndrome who appear in itim the sort of person who is entirely gungho when it comes to ugliness and strangeness being portrayed so starkly that it is beautiful happily for me this is pretty much exactly how what is it presents itself to viewers glover uses the strange images of snails death and the disabled in part because he wants his audience to feel discomfort at either the sheer oddness of the imagery or the visceral reaction one has to the dying screams of an anthropomorphized snail in some ways the weirdly compelling and occasionally downright grotesque elements of what is it remind me of the work of the painter francis bacon he of the infamous popes yes and the odd distortions of the human figure that inevitably make viewers cringe and want to look away like bacons paintings glovers film manages to be opulent and humble grainy and polished chaotic and wellrealized and the contradictions help to make it all the more disconcerting but still this is not an entirely serious film and it largely manages to sidestep the greatest pitfalls of pretension through the use of humor that for the most part derives from the use and juxtaposition of familiar items images and names of popular culture and when what is it is funny it is very funnyoverall what is it is an impressive first film from glover as a director and writer and his presence as an actor in the film proves not to be nearly the distraction one might expect it to be watching it is like being an observer in the kind of dream that isnt exactly good or bad but just strange and that leaves you feeling slightly grimy when you wake up if thats the kind of art you enjoy what is it is likely to exceed your expectations and be wellworth the effort of catching it in the theatre along with the big slide show and glover himself all in all its an experience youre unlikely to forget any time soon,1,-1,positive,
i havent read this book but all through the movie i was awestruck with only one thought in my head this is so vonnegut i have never seen an author all of the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel translated so well to film this movie had the same complexities found in vonneguts novels the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic and the dramatic events and symbols were often also jokescampbell was also a very vonnegut character portrayed perfectly by nick nolte he had all of the earmarks of a vonnegut hero lack of concern for political boundaries ironic dark humor giving way to dumb inactivity in response to stress and an unwillingness to push his version of reality on those around himoverall i was constantly surprised and impressed as i watched this movie it was the same feeling i had reading cats cradle my first vonnegut novel as if the most perfectly oddball thing that could happen he thought of that and he made it real and important yes he has nothing but army surplus white christmas albums so it goes,1,-1,positive,
a fine martino outing this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads george hilton and anita strindbergfor me the jigsaw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists enjoyable twists it has to be saidsexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london athens and greek coastal locations a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all,1,-1,neutral,

terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever and as for the feminist polemic its laughable i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief im glad i did go to see it thats because i now have an immediate answer to the question whats the worst film youve ever seen plus i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world as is revealed in the closing creditsi only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film all it took was a bunch of frilly costumes a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public so why shouldnt she think she could get away with the selfindulgent nothingness that is the tango lesson,0,0,negative,

i saw heavens gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing ciminos long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece the deerhunter the reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence an influential new york film critic led the way and most critics followed suit and the 3hr 40min film was pulled from distribution united artists had cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was rereleased many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business the film at that time cost about 40 million dollars now considered low budget making it one of the most expensive in history and cimino had free rein on the project with endless retakes despite it being only his third film the deerhunter had also received a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology which was not popular i mention all this to present a possible bias building up against cimino at the time i thought the film was very good and when i saw the shorter version it was still very good only less so the film showed up again in a museum in the early 1990s they were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing print nevertheless seeing the film years later i now thought heavens gate was a masterpiece finally the long version started to appear in a few select cities i got to see it recently and it was well worth the wait heavens gate begins with the graduation ceremony at harvard university two of the graduates are kris kristofferson and john hurt and we some of the flaws in their characters early on despite the mandate joseph cotton gives in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to enlighten and improve their country many of the graduates behave as if they are part of an elite country club the film flashes ahead 20 years to johnson county in wyoming a cattle company called the stockholders association has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves kristofferson sides with the immigrants while john hurt is part of the association although hurt is totally against this insane action he is too ineffectual a character to do anything about it a massacre takes place but the immigrants do well in defending themselves a united states cavalry comes to the rescue of the association to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they sanctioned the mass killing kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his harvard days married bored on a yacht living but dead on the insidethis is a very complex film which is brilliant in every department such as its themes structure direction cinematography writing music editing set designs and acting kristofferson walken hurt huppert dourif bridges waterston and cotton are all excellent portraying very complex characters some of the major complaints i read about this film state that is ugly to look at incoherent too long that the characters make no sense and that the words are often unintelligible in its defense heavens gate has the look of photographs of that period just as mccabe mrs miller did some of the scenes are smoky looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses wagons people are passing by from all sides creating a sense of realitythe critic who called it one of the ugliest movies ever made likes to use his thumbs a lot but in spite of all that the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable the film makes a great deal of sense if you pay attention to it everything is not spelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or its themes as to its length it is a beautifully structured piece at times moving poetic exhilarating or devastating with virtually one great scene following another at times some of the words are unintelligible especially in some of the scenes bustling with activity but one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language the glances between characters or their actions one day soon this film should be rereleased in its full length so that people and critics could give it a second chance do not let michael cimino become another orson welles under appreciated in his lifetime and not able to make the kinds of great films he is capable of making,1,1,positive,

the combination of dan haggerty elves and linda blair exorcist is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie and once you see the cover art to this film of a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic chamber youll think you were in bmovie horror heaven at least thats the way i approached this film but boy was i in for a shocki love horror movies i love bmovies as well nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies monsters murderers that sort of thing but to say that this movie was lacking is an understatement this movie was pure trash youd think the zombies would look somewhat like what the coverart of the box displays but instead you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any halloween display counter furthermore the script is beyond pitiful our main character joseph suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the warmhearted mary played by blair not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of josephs character instead we see the head of the cryogenic labs a man named dr miller eager to get the dead bodies and experiment with their organs there is no emotion or anything to make you believe you should give a damn about anyone in this filmall and all very disappointing all the elements to make a great horror film were there you had your zombies your decent actors and your story but the lack of good writing and little if any sense of direction screwed this one up royally overall 4 out of 10,0,-1,positive,

i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts her characters rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft the trip had been turned down by the us airforce navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules,0,-1,neutral,
man i cant believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie okay it sure aint no sophisticated work of cinematic art but it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun for starters the titular pumpkinheaded supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera he looks like something you would see in a fourthrate carnival spookhouse secondly the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultraconservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster then theres the always welcome presence of the everlovely linnea quigley whos memorably introduced taking a nice long utterly gratuitous shower that goes on for two minutes amazingly we also have appearances by deceased schlock picture legends john carradine as an evil warlock and cameron mitchell as a horror tv show host moreover scream queens brinke stevens and dawn wildsmith have fleeting cameos lead child actor ryan latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of a moldy old tree stump pretty brunette rachel carter pops her top and bares her cute little breasts the cruddy special effects are decidedly less than special the score is suitably overwrought yet this film overall has a certain endearingly hokey appeal to it which in turn makes this honey a real delectably cheesy hoot to watch,1,1,positive,
deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn every single turn in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film and it often doesnt make any sense although they do usually catch you by surprise the story is very good except for the fact that it has so many twists the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters but you cant catch all the development because of the twists the performances particularly by caine are amazing the direction is very good sidney lumet can direct the visual effects are fair but than again most are actually in a play and are fake twists way to much but still works and is worth watching,1,1,positive,

what offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of originality this film does not contain one innovating element if by originality you refer to pathetic action scenes overacting gluttony in violence blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief then originality is something swedish film can do withouthow rse and karlsson can agree to act in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me and how eva rse after the making of this film can be seen at breakfasttv promoting it just disappoints methis film doesnt contain a story the script is illogical stiff and last but not least just plain bad these two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boyfantasy containing violence comicstrips and trivialized psychological portraits i wouldnt be surprised if the scene of dd masturbating in the kitchen over a microwave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directorsi wouldnt show this movie to my worst enemy,0,0,negative,
i read that this did not well that the story is not solid that volckman feels he has failed in some wayi disagree first it is well executed volckman is doing well to not only to try a new technique but to have a focus that is worth thinking about would immortality reduce the value of life big question i can see he trying hard to build a feeling and he is not compromising this is to be applauded i am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form i have seen artists reduce a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment i identify this film with thisfurther it is much more interesting than richard linklaters rotoscoping and volckmans story has more meaning than linklaters later stories of a wasted life on drugs old news everyone knows it but no one does anything about it renaissance has more to offer something new to think about and there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far betterwell done volckman really nice work,1,-1,neutral,

a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this threadi was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it mandatory or compulsoryi think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizingthe global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to do right it appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people because it doesnt have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to be good goingand thats the problem with the film al gore is a politician and a very successful one at that he just cant help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would the political appeal is just too greatand there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to do rightanother interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people,0,1,positive,

so youve seen the romero movies yes and youve seen jacobs ladder right and the later hellraiser movies okay now lets make a movie out of all three only lets just jam everything together and make a whole big mess of it sounds like a good ideathis movie is terrible absolutely godawful yeah its an indie flick who gives a crap is that a pass to make filmic excrement the film attempts to establish credibility by focusing on character interaction that much is evident unfortunately for the writers theyre not good at character interaction this isnt night of the living dead the characters are nonentities shouting their inane lines at each other in a vain attempt to be caught by the microphones on set the dialogue is never interesting for a movie that focuses so much on character interaction youd think the characters would have something more to say than what are we going to do i dont know well weve got to do something well what are we going to do i dont know we should leave lets just accept our fate no weve got to leave well lets leave then no maybe we should staythis isnt exaggeration there are exchanges in this film that reach that level of redundancy and inanitythe worst thing about this movie half of it is a dream and it really has zero purpose nothing in the dream has any relevance to anything in the rest of the movie the writers couldnt decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they just made both its patently ridiculous the cheapest trick in the book and its maddeningly insulting especially since im pretty sure they ripped off the idea from jacobs ladder which handled the concept a hell of a lot more competently than these jokers could ever hope to doand then theres the editing years of watching mtv and playing horrorthemed video games must have inspired the filmmakers but its surely a sad thing they didnt realize what made the choppy editing and obfuscation in those pieces of media effective in the first place in this film you will be confused often and not in the good david lynch way but in the bad wait i thought she just got killed no then who the hell was that wait who is that guy where did he come from how did they get here kind of way its constant and consistently badthis movie is a laughable piece of trash and should only be sought out if you want to get trashed with a few friends and laugh at itand as a final note as for the comedy people in other reviews are talking about its all unintentional there isnt a single intentional piece of comedy in this film its all supposed to be a big serious character study because the filmmakers want to have credibility in their horrorconcept sadly their pretensions dont match up to their ability,0,0,negative,

this movie was absolute torture first of all its a whopping 4 hours long true the kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for but every single one of those battles need not have been shown so maybe this is a documentary not a commercial film as advertised sure didnt seem like it as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws the battle sequences were so poorly executed i am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in border each battle was the exact same as the previous it was so predictable this might be a spoiler the whole army marches uphill five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each they also use the same cussword every time one of the lead actors is shot someone yells for a stretcher the actor says no dont get a stretcher that will take 6 men from the battalion and then an actor dies that exact same thing happens over and over and over again oh and the songs are so bad and so long the cast of the movie is too big for its own good despite such a long movie none of the characters were well developed the actresses had the most miniscule roles they all are dressed and portrayed to be the same two of them were weeping synchronized it was so comical they moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta togetherthe list just goes on and on i know im still forgetting something anyways i think i have bashed the film enough that you get the picture,0,0,negative,

surprisingly enjoyable movie a group of thieves lead by mark wahlberg rob a gold safe in italy and thankfully for them the heist is successful and they get away with it without any big problems before the group can celebrate however steve played by ed norton decides he want the gold all for himself and pulls a cout de ta on the group and shoots one of the members he and his accomplices leave thinking that the group is dead but luckily the group is not dead a year later we get back into the story where the group has tracked down norton and decide to steal the gold back and spend the rest of the movie coming up with plans to steal back their gold and settle a scorethis was a surprise for me it had all the makings to be a typical forgettable summer movie but it was actually memorable and really fun to watch what i like is how smart and well thought out the plans in the movie are and how the movie feels realistic watching the trailer would make you think it was some mindless action movie but in fact there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are all really well done the latter action scene is a very long 20 min scene that has one of the best car chases ever done i like how real the chase is and how everything is done old school style without the aid of cgi me personally i enjoyed this car chase more than the cgi filled chase in matrix 2 i remember watching music videos by director f gary gray and always noticed how well made they were and thought hed make a great filmmaker turns out i was right as always and he proves it here cant wait to see what he does with the sequel the actors do a decent job too with seth green being my favorite of the group the other thing i loved was the excellent score by john powell ever since i heard his score for robots this year ive been a fan of him and paying close attention to his music and the man is really good he does a great job of avoiding all the typical summer action movie musical clichs and provides a very well done score i havent seen the original that this is based on so i cant really say how well it stacks up to that oneso yeah this is a great popcorn movie that actually has a brain unlike most of the summer movie crap that comes out has great characters is funny as hell and has a amazing score by john powell if you love heist movies then youll love this one you know if i was in the group theyd call me handsome mike,1,1,positive,
repetitive music annoying narration terrible cinematography effects half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fightone of the best scenes was in the deleted scenes section the one where shes in the principles office with her mom i dont understand why theyd cut that the movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movieridiculous camera work is reminiscent of mtv and completely not needed or helpful to a movie speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used its like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didnt want to throw awayanother movie with jerry springer in it that shouldve told me not to watch it from the previewa popular movie for the in crowd,0,0,positive,

playing out as a sort of pre runner to the great escape some 13 years later this smashing little british film plays it straight with no thrills and dare do well overkill first part of the movie is the set up and subsequent escape of our protagonists whilst the second part concentrates on their survival whilst on the run as they try to reach sweden the film relies on pure characters with simple effective and yes believable dialogue to carry it thru and it achieves its aims handsomely no little amount of suspense keeps the film ticking along and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the time frame it adheres to so a big thumbs to the film that may well be the first of its type 710,1,1,positive,
if like me you enjoyed the first film bruce almighty my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high in fact disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any filmsense at allwithout giving too much away the story sees evan bruces nemesis coanchor from the first film move home with his family to the virginian suburbs to change the world with a new political path what follows is a rather farfetched and quite silly storyline which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience unlike its predecessor evan almighty is a family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of comedy tagged upon its misleading position of sequel to which some would regard a modernday comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature upscale audiencegenerally speaking evan almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic values the acting omit steve carell and morgan freeman was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production additionally the cast includes acting legend john goodman who makes an appearance as a heel and is seen just a few times in the movies entirety i didnt quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for a family comedy every other character in the movie especially the wife and kids deserve a mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill a kingsize kiev be warned though it is the typical americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream familyorientated films so id advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sightit may seem the movie is worthless thusfar however it does have some promising aspects the cgi was outstanding and it was clear that a lot of time went into modelling the ark and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end the particles renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar although part of me couldnt help but think these were undeserving to a movie with such poor ideals and were in my opinion too good for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughoutoverall i view this film as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with huge potential but unfortunately it fell short to a bad conclusion in the almighty series and approaching the end of the film i had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content i had so far witnessed this wasnt the case and i was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits as i sat discontent i couldnt help but think the movie wasnt anywhere near as mighty as i hoped for in many ways the film reminded me of a watered down night at the museum as it showed similar styling and characteristics but unfortunately was leagues below even thati give this movie 3 out of 10 as it is watchable but its definitely one to be avoided if you have to see this film be prepared for disappointment as mildly entertained is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production,0,0,positive,
those of you who know the group deus know the lead singer tom barman he directed this movie a bit like he creates music its a mix of everything this is a comedy though mostly absurd and cynical a drama none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least and it does not really have a goalthe movie starts on a friday morning in antwerp belgium with scenes of several persons some of them have nothing in common but they will come in contact with each other during the day and night there are several main characters a teacher who writes books nobody reads a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister a gallery owner two young men constantly in touch with the law a man who works in a movie theater and two young women throughout the movie there walks a man who has something to do with wind all characters have their troubles with their family or friends or just with life itselfthe movie is set in antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and the port the events of the day are not easily explained i advise to simply watch the movie there is simply too much to tell but i can say this barman has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music mostly dance music not really rock to set a mood especially the party is filled with excellent musicthis movie is an experience on itself it will not leave you any wiser about life perhaps only that you have to live it and not waste it or have any false moral truthsin short see it it is definitely worth it,1,1,positive,
its hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry,0,-1,neutral,

edmund burke said that all evil needs is for good me to do nothing hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith it had no violence no lewdness and did not deserve a pg rating the western scenery was filmed well and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking actors were a bit young for their parts but otherwise believable and talented music score was too loud and in some places drowned out the dialog completely im seldom surprised by movie endings any more but i was pleasantly surprised by this one sometimes the good guys do win and they win by honest efforts we liked the movie and the message and would recommend it for the entire family,1,-1,neutral,

the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most movergoers were stayathomes watching their new 7 motorola televisions almost all recent box office figures are false because they fail to adjust inflation obviously todays 10 movies will dominate in 1951 it cost 90c to 160 at radio city 44c to 75c first run at loews palace in washington dc or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs what counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso really not a great story anyway and threw it in the trash instead 90 of the movies focus was on the music thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the bestever historic opera singer enrico caruso the result was a wonderful movie too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating too fat to play the student prince edmund purdom took his place with lanzas voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and notfat lanza pictured in the advertising if you want to see the great caruso its almost always on ebay for 200 or less dont be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy availability of copies not the quality of the movie,1,1,positive,
one used to say concerning nathaniel hawthorne that his failures were more interesting than his successes i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonaldeddys pictures and especially this one it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie its kitsch the script because of censorship sounds inconsistent yet this movie gets also some good points good rodgersharts music i married an angel tira tira tira la good acting with eehorton and reginald owen anyway if you may dislike it you cant forget it this strange movie actually leaves a very strong dreamlike impression and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days maybe for weeks why in the thirties and the beginning of the forties movies didnt have the same mean than today it aimed like a dream to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality of all the the dreammovies that was made in that time this one stands as particularly powerfulin short lets say that the better way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without wondering whether its good or bad to watch it like you would watch a dream,1,0,negative,
who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother could possibly be good cinema i certainly didnt i thought i knew what to expect one of the most boring experiences of my life well i was as wrong as i havent been wrong too often yet because this is one of the best most realistic and honest hollywood films ive ever seengiving a short resume of the straight story isnt very difficult its about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke thats already special on itself but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasnt seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument in the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks not knowing if he will reach his goal seeing his brother again before its too latei can easily understand why there are people who dont like this movie and thats also the reason why i will not say that these people dont have a heart or things like that this movie hasnt got any flashy action scenes it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no you dont have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either because there isnt any but why should you watch it then well the simple answer is the story i havent seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from hollywood and to make things even better from the disney studios thats right the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense makes it even more special im not ashamed to admit that i had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for mesome people will argue that the story is very shallow but i really dont agree with that perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and dont want to think any further if you look close enough than youll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too so they wont make the same mistake if that isnt deep enough how much deeper does a story have to go for you then i would also like to add that this movie really had it all some beautiful landscapes finally an american movie that shows something else than the skyline of new york chicago or some other big city some very fine acting by richard farnsworth sissy spacek and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a david lynch movie i know now that i was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldnt be to my taste its one of the very best movies ive seen in a long time this movie aimed for my heart and hit the bulls eye i give it the full 1010,1,0,positive,
when i typed savage intruder into the imdbs search engine one of the options it came up with was savage garden international video collection the story so far 1999 the only reason i mention this is because im a huge savage garden fan you should do yourself a favour check some of their music out like affirmation or to the moon and back rather than bother with this average potboiler sorry i just wanted to say that anyway savage intruder starts with a bizarre montage of what looks like mgm musical premiere footage a few spinning portraits which have no meaning whatsoever in the long run its late 60s hollywood amid the glitz glamour a serial killer is at work selecting ageing actresses killing them dismembering their bodies a young man named vic valance david garfield as john david garfield hops off a tour bus looking for employment when it stops at the house of a now retired actress katharine parker miriam hopkins who was one of the biggest stars of the motion picture but now lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named mildred florence lake a personal secretary leslie blair gale sondergaard a young maid named geta virginia wing katharine has recently broken her foot needs a personal assistant gives vic the job slowly vic charms his way into katharines affections more importantly her large wallet vic starts to turn katharine against the other employees but vic isnt what he seems vic is a drug addicted loon who gets greta pregnant while still having sex with katharine greta threatens to tell katharine spoil vics devious plans but she has a close encounter with an axe no one in the house is safe as vic brings drugs sex rock n roll partys gardening to the parker mansion while his sinister plan starts to become more more apparentwritten produced directed by donald wolfe i thought savage intruder was a bit of a mess but a mildly entertaining one at the same time the script is all over the place it cant really decide what it wants to be savage intruder suffers from an identity crisis the film starts with the discovery of a severed head limbs straight after another woman dorothy kingston is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure but then it completely ditches the slasher film elements that it has just built up never going back to them savage intruder then becomes a sort of feel good film as vic befriends katharine shows her how to enjoy life again having an implied sexual relationship with her its actually disgusting to think about as shes old enough to be his grandmother katharine stops living the life of a recluse gives up the alcohol as vic appears to make her happy as they go to partys together hold banquets for katharines friend like she used too this part of savage intruder wouldnt look out of place in a disney film every so often the tedium of the feel good stuff is interrupted by vic shooting up having silly hallucinations about his mother sybelle guardino chopping her hand off with an axe he has sex with great at one point as well then after greta has been murdered savage intruder becomes a bizarre horror film as vic is revealed for the loony that he is savage intruder just doesnt flow properly as a film in my opinion as it mixes various genres with little success similarly the murder mystery elements dont work are frankly a bit of a puzzle why go to great lengths to conceal the killers identity during the murder scenes but then make it perfectly clear who is committing them throughout the rest of the film anyway vic as a character didnt work for me either one moment hes a cool calm clever devious con man then next hes a stark raving loony why kill all his other victims but with katharine try to con her what makes her so different if it is because she has money why not go after her to start with so many questions so few answers some of the 60s dialogue is pretty funny to listen to these days like when vic offers greta a painkiller in reality hard drugs greta says what do i need a painkiller for vic helpfully replies because your a pain wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies or when katharine suggests that vic do some gardening asks do you have green fingers he replies no but im good at grass there isnt much gore in savage intruder some severed limbs a couple of decapitated heads there is also a fairly impressive shot when someone has their hand cut off with an axe which is probably why its repeated three or four times the silly looking drug hallucination scenes need to be seen to be believed technically savage intruder is ok the location filming in the grandiose mansion hollywood hills probably give it a better look than it deserves the acting is average as is the rest of the production overall id say savage intruder feels like it tries to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away as a result just doesnt work its a mildly entertaining onetimewatch at best a complete mess of a film at worse you decide which,0,1,positive,

me and my girlfriend annette watched this together and well both commentboth of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with dickens work a lot of dickens works are somewhat dark and dreary including oliver twist but this movie changed all that it was fun colourful both visually and musically and the characters were more lightheartedtravis normally i dont care a lot for musical and dance movies but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively and the choreography was awesomeannette thats really saying a lot coming from travis i cant emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were you can tell for example that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfectiontravis three actors really stood out imo nancy shani w bill sykes oliver reed and artful dodger jack wild man that oliver reed can really do a good villain that one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the backawesome and that kid jack wild was a perfect artful dodger and nancy was fantastic man i felt bad when she got killed she can sing too kudos to the casting department on their choices there i hated the oliver twist kid tho he was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste i kept wishing bill sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene and they shouldnt have had him sing eitherannette acting was truly superb in addition to the three stars travis mentioned i felt ron moody fagin did a tremendous job he was so funny and at the same time lightly sinister too the supporting actors were great too harry secombe carried his mr bumble role extremely well and he has a wonderful singing voice i saw mr secombe perform in another movie entitled davy where he played an opera singer with pleasing results the talented harry secombe should have been in a lot more moviestravis as i mentioned earlier the story isnt quite true to the book but imo it was more robust this movie was not boring either as some musicals seem to be and the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters the tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too longannette any musical movie which travis watches completely has to be a rare find and this one is indeed a rare find it is a very easytowatch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end in a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces this was a refreshing interludeour combined rating for this was 85 of 10 well round up to 9 in this casetravis i rated this a 7 mainly because the oliver twist kid mark l irritated me and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears otherwise it was an outstanding movieannette my rating is a 10 movies dont get much better than this and you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it wasa masterpieceplease dont miss this oneeven if you normally dont like musicals it really is a rare treat,1,1,positive,

this is paul f ryans first and only fulllength feature he hasnt done anything since however he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story i dont know when or why the idea emerged in his head but ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie home roombusy philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as alicia a troubled girl the ones we always see in television series with dark hair and black clothes a package of cigarettes in the pocket weird look and disturbing eyes with makeup of course an event has occurred at her school a shooting some students have died and she saw everything now detective martin van zandt victor garber is investigating the case and as expected alicia is a suspect but the shooting is just the genesis the movie is not about the shootinglying in bed in a hospital room is deanna cartwright erika christensen she is one of the survivors of the hospital the script establishes a bond between them by the school principal james pickens jr he is helping all the students to recover from the event but alicia doesnt seem to care shes isolated so the principal punishes her she needs to visit deanna every day until five o clock then the movie startsi cant even describe how wonderfully written i think the movie is i can identify with the characters and the situations they live i like reality these things could happen to anyone and the things they say are totally understandable theyre growing up and trying to deal with things they havent experienced theyre doing their best without knowing it alicia when she visits deanna for the first time and deanna when she sees alicia standing in front of her are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life after high schoolthe director leads christensen and philipps through their roles very well look the contrast between them deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts no complexity inside of her mind when alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks who has brought them many people deanna answers although some days later we learn theyre from her parents who come every week the parental figures are all well represented but are not as important as their sons characters deanna is lonely alicia seems mature and violent smoking cigarettes and talking roughly but after two days of visiting she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day even sleeping in deannas room all night when they both have a fight afterwards i believe deanna says why do you keep coming back alicia is lonely toothe ending of the movie without ruining it comes a bit disappointing its something i wasnt waiting for it eliminates some of the strength the movie has the revelation comes totally unnecessary ruining the logical climax the movie could have had it was an excellent script anyway and an excellent direction a damn fine moviewhen it comes to erika christensen this was the role she needed to fly higher her role in traffic was impressing but this was the big step the main role maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film and thats a pity she hasnt made one false move since then she has even come out with good performances in awful movies on the other hand busy philipps who proved to be very promising in this movie what a transformation hasnt got many opportunities for other rolesthe same i say about paul f ryan in directing of curse and i expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script im waiting for his next movie im hoping the best for all of them,1,1,positive,

my take on this at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than i may actually have been began with a head shake well i cant summarize the plot but its a really superb character study of an extremely scary man then slight embarrassment i ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down that is from whom trebor unwittingly gets his new heart itd been my last film in a long long day halfway through the festival maybe id dozed the better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming dont know did know there was an ohenry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished and knew it had to do with the heart hence the quietly hilarious talent search my plotloss remark had more to do with intricacies of trebors connections in france his relation to the dog woman and so on stuff id been wide awake for denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another directors treatmentbut i write these things too often from memory especially festival films films whose dvd i dont have at hand le lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions still or already linrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of darkside superman a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible relatively softspoken driven but patient right among us the scar once he attains it makes him just visually i mean in image a sort of hybrid frankenstein monster mad doctor and creation all in one the actual doctors are his tools if he doesnt extract and install the heart himself its only because its not possible hes the force always the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself what else is he to suggest that hes us the first world versus the third seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow first worlders on all of usdeniss cameras eye when it looks at things i know goes usually where mine would so i tend to trust her when she looks at things i dont know snow trekking toofast bicycling and forest darkness ive known in small ways but the south seas not at all so i made better entry into lintrus both france and the crystalline isles of its finish than into beau travail lintrus is for me a very comfortable discomforting film its a sequence of places portrayed familiarly with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether weve seen the reality or not a single image trebor cycling his massive weight on the thin racing frame the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires the asphalt ribbon the darkinbrightsun evergreens cued me that the film would be linear a road trip a single willdriven thrustdespite trebors personal power hes a human failure no matter who hes with hes alone though apparently he hasnt always been his body aborts life twice first to need the new heart then despite it lintrus is tragedy trebor is hubrisim navigating perilously the thread of what i remember lets leave it at that,1,1,neutral,
think charmed with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture a very lame story with mediocre effects and an anticlimax ending to let the door open for a part 2 lets hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser id suggest a charmed the movie because compared to this charmed kicked ass and i only watched that show to please my girlfriend wait and watch it on dvd on a rainy sunday when youve got nothing better to do or better yet download it so you dont waste your money the first 15 minutes were alright but the funniest line from the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when reid says kiss my ass harry potter while driving of a cliff although they are not worthy to kiss potters ass because potter is way cooler and at least his movies have a story the goblet of fire was even scarier than this,0,-1,neutral,
i saw this movie on tv back in the 60s and it still stands up well even after brilliant performances as a di by r lee ermey lou gossett and even frank sutton in a comic vein on gomer pyle usmc i wasnt in the service but my brother had a recording of a drill instructor in the air force and it was scary others in the family who were marines told me that ermey and even sutton were pretty spot on in their roles the only thing missing in the d i is the language in 1958 they couldnt yet use profanity on film yet jack webb came across pretty damned tough without it i think its his best role ever in dragnet he was quite stiff ill admit though not as bad as george raft but he used it only to effect in the d i you never forget the funeral for the dead flea the romantic part was just to stretch the movie but didnt really interfere with the basic plot don dubbins was pretty good to but he never surpassed this film in his career as far as patriotism jack webb was tvs john wayne he carried it a bit too far in some dragnet episodes but not in the d i after 40 some years i hoped the film could stand up to the likes full metal jacket and others and it did,1,-1,positive,

this is not the worst movie ive ever seen i did not feel like i wanted to remove my eyeballs forcibly after watching galaxina it just is not good the jokes are almost funny but fall short all of them the few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over the production values are well nonexistent the sound is bad the lighting is bad it just seems cheaply made overly so the dialog well often it is missing many awkward silences they are all just standing around and it seems like someone should be saying something the film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy like maybe that developed after shooting started it feels like someones film project that they threw together the night before it was due and if they had put two weeks into it it could have been goodand im easy to please i thought mom and dad save the world was a hoot i like pluto nash mystery men is one of my favorite movies spaced invaders is well nigh unto a classic this turkey just doesnt do it space truckers was more believableavery schreiber who can be very funny tries too hard his part calls for a straightman and he plays it leaning toward sitcom dorothy stratten is ok in her role but not particularly noteworthyoh yeah the my watch is always slow line was funny ill give this movie all the kudos it can get it needs itthe space vehicle models are not bad but they are few and are not used effectively the space scenes are vague no sweeping passes no close up detailed flybys not even appropriate action scenes when they dock the infinity does crash land very oddly at one point the flight dynamics are terrible worse than anything youve seen theyre jerky not smooth the initial battle is stilted and static even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion they trade slow shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a 16th century sea battle except not as excitingthe aliens imagine if all of star wars was the cantina scene that many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly no a few are used as sight gags that work ok the first time but not the fifthmercifully if you attempt to watch galaxina you are likely to fall asleep i got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes and did not feel like it was worth replaying it if that doesnt say it sucked i dont know what does sadly there is a lot of potential and this could easily have been a good movie it would be easy to remake this and have a decent filmmadkaugh,0,0,negative,
i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind the trauma the suspense is just amazing i ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it and relating it to reality movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you dont forget those that make you doubt your reality a problem could be the quality but that doesnt bring down the essence of the moviethe idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer i just totally loved it so many clues and twitches and puzzles one of the best movies ever hands down,1,1,positive,

the first word i can find to describe this movie is awfulthis movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen first of all is the plot a very thin plot wont comment further on this part and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following this makes the movie so bad because you know whats going to happen secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed one of the questions and this is no spoiler is what the hell are the kids doing in that corn thirdly is the characters very bad not only because the movie is bad but also because of the sorry actors they are bad as they can bethe last thing that make this movie bad is that its a horror movie you are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks but you are not scared you a not horrified because you know whats going to happenconclusion the movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants i hoped that it was a very great movie but because the story is bad the actors are bad the film raises a lot of questions and because its not scary the movie is best unseen,0,0,positive,
the cats meow contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue and some fine performances a few of which surprised me eddie izzard is more effective than i expected as chaplin partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer joanna lumley is compelling as novelist elinor glyn and kirsten dunst is winning as marion davies though why movies never use her reallife stutter is difficult to explain but these elements dont add up to a successful whole the screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenesthe meetings between davies and chaplin are particularly well craftedbut not so hard on the big picture several minor characters dont need to be there and dont behave consistently the basic plot is full of illogic eg why does thomas ince think its a good idea to tell hearst something he really doesnt want to hear and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome id like to think a trip on hearsts yacht was more fun than the movie indicates davies is characterized as a standard bubbly flapper type which isnt really accurate and the screenwriters ideas about chaplin and love are implausible strangely bogdanovich who seemed so connected to the thirties in paper moon lacks a similar affinity for the twenties he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period eg yes we have no bananas when hearst insists everybody charleston charleston it looks as if the actors had a tenminute dance lesson just before the scene was shot the lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies im sure but not this time,0,1,positive,
it is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance however moronic this illogical logic may be however within the story and theme of the film there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the films antagonist is the villain of the story under no circumstances can what she did be justified sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality it is betrayal of the ultimate sort the man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another mans offspring to top it all the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 liberated female characters in the climax is pathetic a womans sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse there are no other children so in essence his life has been wasted in some societies where justice still prevails such situations result in the execution of the unjust,0,-1,neutral,

harry langdons saturday afternoon is often ranked among the greatest silent comedies at least where short subjects are concerned and therefore may come as a bit of a letdown for some unlike some of the other recognized classics such as keatons cops or chaplins the immigrant this film is in some respects a familiar conventional situation comedy and doesnt offer much in the way of belly laughs one may even wonder whether langdon belongs in such rarefied company nonetheless in my opinion its a perfectly charming comedy in its minorkey way and harry is fascinating to watchfor a modern viewer raised on tv sitcoms the plot of saturday afternoon may suggest the honeymooners or its many spinoffs two dim guys one of whom is married and very much under his wifes thumb try to sneak out with a couple of goodtime girls for a fun afternoon but everything goes wrong and they wind up having to fight the girls tough guy boyfriends does this sound familiar and perhaps a little dreary well the premise was already shopworn when this film was made but beyond that nothing about langdon was typical he was odd starting with the fact that he looked like a middleaged baby who was half asleep any freudians who catch saturday afternoon will have a field day with the scenes between this timid pudgyfaced babyman and his stern gently domineering mommywife when harry tries to hide money under the rug but she catches him in the act and forces him to hand it over youd swear youre watching an interaction between a 6 yearold boy and his mama and maybe thats why harry langdon gave some people the creeps and still doesbut hes a compelling screen figure and its not what he does so much as the way he does it in that scene with the coins under the rug for instance harry finds the coins by placing one foot before the other carefully like a tightrope walker counting off his paces until he finds the right spot and his technique is hypnotic langdon moved like no one else whether or not he makes you laugh the guy is mesmerizing seemingly in a world of his own where the plot of his films is concerned harry is curiously passive and almost never drives the story forward himself in the finale of saturday afternoon when the big fistfight is taking place harrys costar vernon dent is in the thick of the action but harry is in a daze for much of the time and winds up sort of punchdrunk between two cars sitting on the running board of one but with his feet on the other while they race through the streets its a memorable image and as the critic walter kerr wrote it encapsulates langdons screen persona quite perfectly hes a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of frantic action blinking sleepily while the world rushes past its also worth noting that langdon and dent who worked together frequently have a rapport in this movie that suggests a blueprint laurel hardy would follow when they teamed up a year or so later langdons style was a likely influence on stan laurel especially heresaturday afternnon and its star may not be for everyone but the film is well worth a look and you might find that langdon makes an impression thats hard to shake,1,1,positive,

rules of engagement is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen it is well constructed superbly pieced together and provides excellent footage to back up the assertions that it takes on the movies best quality is that it is not based on being sympathetic to the dividians as much as it enlightens the audience to the blatant governmental mistakes and lies that surrounded the entire situation im left with feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger over the way that the government handled and then covered up a tragedy of this magnitude the cover up is what left me really fuming it is one thing to make a mistake in an operation and admit guilt but another to look the american people squarely in the eye and lie to them i guess it shouldnt surprise me with the history of our beloved country that has seen the jfk assassination the vietnam war and other significant events that smell so bad of a cover up that you have to hold your nose every time you drive through washington dc the footage from an airplane with special heat sensing technology and the autopsies on some of the bodies clearly show that the fbi is lying to the public one of the things that i try to stay aware of when watching a documentary such as this is that i am usually only receiving testimony from one point of view but again that is without a doubt one of the brilliant successes of rules of engagement it presents its evidence in such a concluding fashion that even if you were presented with statements from the fbi how could you really believe them i remember clearly when the standoff was taking place the way the media presented the dividians as this crazed group of cult rebels with david koresh the self professed reborn jesus christ as their leader none of this was truly factual but rather story spun from bits and pieces of facts they were simply standing up for there rights to bear arms and practice their religion as american citizens if you were the atf and you wanted to search the compound is attacking the building with a unit of men who are armed with rifles and bullet proof suits the way to go about doing it if you are the fbi why engage in psychological warfare and offer little in actual negotiation to help solve the situation why pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children why open large holes within the compound structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire why lie about not firing weapons when it can be clearly shown on video unless unless you wanted to see the situation end up the way it did the scene at the end when the dividians star of david flag blew off the flagpole into the fire and the atfs was shortly thereafter raised up was an emotional climatic scene that made my head shake in disgust and my stomach turn uncontrollably the filmmaker william gazecki deserves one my highest congratulations it takes a lot of guts to make a movie like this and i am sure there have been many repercussions from the government for it as well because of people like him the public can be shown real truth rather than crap that gets filtered through a media that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine when i think back to how i felt at the time toward the dividians because of the medias representation of david koresh and how i felt after seeing this movie it is truly amazing it reminds me of the line from the bible of a man who was healed by jesus and asked by the elders how it happened before i was blind but now i can see he kept telling them do yourself a favor and watch this movie you may have to look for it but it is truly something special,1,1,positive,
part two picks up not where the last film left off as part of the quasiconventionality of steven soderberghs epic 4 hour event ches two stories are told as classic rise and fall scenarios in part two che guevara leaving his post as a bureaucrat in cuba and after a failed attempt in the congo only in passing mentioned in the film goes down to bolivia to try and start up another throughthejungle style revolution things dont go quite as well planned at all probably because of ches then notorious stature as a communist and revolutionary and in part because of americas involvement on the side of the bolivian government and of course that castro wasnt really around as a backup for cheas it goes the second part of che is sadder but in some ways wiser than the first part which makes sense as guevara has to endure low morale from his men betrayals from those around him constant mistakes by grunts and nearby peasants and by ultimately the enclosing larger military force but whats sadder still is that guevara no matter what wont give in one may see this as an incredible strength or a fatal flaw maybe both but its also clear how one starts to see che if not totally more fully rounded then as something of a more sympathetic character true he did kill and executed and felt justified all the way and yet it starts to work on the viewer in the sense of a primal level of pity the sequence where guevaras health worsens without medicine leading up to the shocking stabbing of a horse marks as one of the most memorable and satisfying of any film this yearagain soderberghs command of narrative is strong if on occasion slightly sluggish understandable due to the big running time and one or two scenes just feel totally odd matt damon but these are minor liabilities going this time for the straight color camera approach this is almost like a pure militiastyle war picture told with a great deal of care for the men in the group as well as guevara as the lordover this group and how things dwindle down the final scene and as always deltoro is at the top of his game in every scene every beat knowing this guy so well for better and for worse that he comes about as close to embodiment as possible overall the two parts of che make up an impressive package history as drama in compelling style good for an audience even if they dont know che or better if they dont think highly of him its that special 8510,1,1,positive,
back in august 81 there was a countryish buzz to movies big hits like urban cowboy every which way but loose smokey and the bandit were all the rage for that reason i suspect the producers of this movie chose honky tonk freeway as the title hoping it would help the movies box office receipts by drawing in that same urban cowboy crowd instead honky tonk freeway bombed at the theaters and i suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of its time no matter what probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy itits too bad this movie bombed but i think it would have anyway even if it hadnt been saddled with a poor title its a movie ahead of its time one could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or greatuncle anyway to the kinds of comedy made today for its day honky tonk freeway was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didnt get popular in comedy till much later on while clearly its a child of airplane its more mature and while its certainly no knocked up it clearly points in that direction the characters are more comedymature in that they are lowkey and dont ever think anything they do is anything other than serious the jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situationsbut more than that honky tonk freeway is a real time capsule a great look back at the exceedingly early 80s the people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did it was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around themi dont know if my review is helping you but this is really a good sometimes kind of excellent movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger beverly dangelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes so are beau bridges and terri garr terry garr was just about to become the toast of hollywood as her next movie after this one was tootsie which finally made her a star howard hessmann was arguably the biggest current star of the the day when this movie was made back in 1981 howard hessmann was the star of the big hit tv show wkrp in cinncinatti he played its lead character the rascally night dj daniel stern was just about to break out as a star as the grownup narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80s sitcom the wonder years there are also several faces that are no longer with us these days its nice to see hume crowyn and jessica tandy as a an old married couple on a journey jessica tandy would finally pick up her oscar ten years after this for driving miss daisy there is also the great geraldine page in one of her final movie appearances though shed had a brilliant career she didnt get her oscar till four years after this in 1985s trip to bountiful for which she richly deserved it and she died very soon after getting that awardplus there are lots of other faces in this movie actors who arent big stars but who have done tons of supporting work many are familiar even if you cant think of their namethis movie is a pleasant little diversion a bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all in a vaguely altmanesk way end up heading towards florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of ticlaw florida which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the mapand thats also what this movie is about fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system which had only recently been completed it had taken a generation to build from when it was authorized by congress around 1960 through many years as different parts were built and then went live and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is and people were enchanted by it everybody by 1980 was pretty much an interstate freeway veteran in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs only on and off ramps and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible by 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom and this was all new then the ending is anticlimatic and isnt that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment what makes it great is its the journey not the destination that makes honky tonk freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day forget its title instead let it take you down memory lane,1,1,positive,
they had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat in the first cruel intentions we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel its actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me it was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded fwords and the end makes absolutely no sense and doesnt explain anything the writing was just terrible another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the exact same lines that were in the original such as down boy or the kissing scene and a few others i cant remember i was not impressed at all by robins acting but amy did a great job thats about the only thing that reconciled this movie,0,-1,positive,

nagisa no shindobaddo or like grains of sand is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are this movie isnt about homosexuality but it is about sexualityaihara an aloof girl will definitely make the viewers ponder who is behind the aloof girl does she love yoshida or does she love ito or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the incident i doubt itand what about yoshida does he realize that he loves ito in the end well we all know he loves him as a friend but youll never know once you see this movie haha in the end aihara along with ito delivers an exceptional message to the audience which is that it does not matter if you love a boy or a girl and i have to tell you im so dense that i didnt get it at first its because of the whole no talking scenes you have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and not by what they say especially the final part whew boy that was confusing its a confusing story but it is beautiful nonetheless this movie is certainly one of the best japanese movies i have ever seen and trust me ive seen plenty,1,-1,positive,
just came out of a sneak preview for this film it had me laughing every 30 secs the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadnt bought that large coke there are definitely some lulls but overall highly entertaining the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in bruce almighty and will ferrell anchorman the legend of ron burgendy in their movies paul rudd is hilarious as always i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas like ps i think that seth rogen should be getting more work because he so freaking talented and engaging leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac however if youre easily offended dont see this movie if youre a rabid feminist dont see this movie and please not matter what even if you think youre one of those hip parents dont take your kids to this movie sure you should let your teens go see this movie just dont watch it with them it would make for some incredibly awkward moments,1,-1,positive,
this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward attended by two orderlies the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the orderlies are gay the orderlies kiss i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny it said comedy on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isntbrilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the mechanics i suppose director and coscriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy cant not for me anywaythe main problem i have with this movie is that i cant see a reason behind the way the main characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything betterthe acting is not bad udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a lighter version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else now i heard he did a comedy about hitler oi vai,0,0,positive,
de dominee is based on the life of a real dutch gangsterklaas bruinsma in the movie he is called klaas donkers i have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened but that doesnt really matter because it failed to grab my attention this movie bored the crap out of me it lacks substance and style the substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action dont we need to be entertained it would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies it is obvious that he didnt otherwise he wouldnt have made this the way he did this movie got a lot of publicity because of a little scandal surrounding klaas bruinsma and a member of the dutch royal family this scandal has nothing to do with the movie what so ever without it de dominee never would have been successful i am sure of it,0,-1,neutral,

that was the first thing that sprang to mind as i watched the closing credits to europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have i seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of europa are so impressive that any film i watch in its wake will only pale in comparison forget your michael bay ridley scott slick hollywood cinematography europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years now id be the first to hail lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark but this is stupid the fact that europa has gone unnoticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like crouching tiger hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards but what do the know europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and until recently any british tv channels the visuals in europa are not mtv gloss its not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style much like his first film the element of crime von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like element the film begins with the main character or in the case of europa we the audience being hypnotized as we move down the tracks the voice of the narrator max von sydow counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in europa this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance its no surprise that the first shot of leopold kessler jeanmarc barr is in colour since he is the only character whos actions have superiority over the film the performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von trier films but thats just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you dont really pick up on them the first time round but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jeanmarc barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act again muck like the element of crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von sydow to seal his fate europa is a tremendous film and i cant help thinking what a shame that von trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes his dedication to composition and miseenscene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design but since his nofrills melodramas turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent 1010,1,-1,positive,

the running man is often dismissed as being just another arnie action thriller full of explosions bad puns and gunfire and to be fair there is a lot of that in it people used to look at it and compare it to the terminator series saying it was one of the poorer schwarzenegger filmsbut give it 18 years and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light rather than just being another brainless action film it works very well as a parody of reality tv it is quite different to the stephen king book true but i doubt whether hollywood with its love of upbeat endings and socalled ordinary guys who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando would have accepted it in its current formbut on with the reviewben richards arnold schwarzenegger is a cop working in a dystopian united states where democracy is a thing of the past and the entire country is ruled by a governmentmedia conglomerate amalgamation the economy is in tatters food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch like jumping for dollars where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs and the most popular one is the running man a gameshow hosted by the slimy damian killian played by the entertaining richard dawson where supposed criminals are hunted down by theatrical prowrestingesquire stalkerssome however try and speak up against the government when a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of bakersfield california a helicopter piloted by richards is sent to calm ie kill the protest when richards refuses to fire on innocent people he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd he is sentenced to a slave labour camp but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader yaphet kotto and goes on the runhowever his freedom does not last long and after he kidnaps network employee amber mendez marita conchita alonso in an attempt to escape those pursuing him he finds himself taken prisoner again but this time he is forced to appear on the running manand there of course the entire film kicks into standard arnie mode richards is launched into the postapocalyptic wasteland of los angeles why is la always destroyed in these dystopian worlds and forced to run from the stalkers along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him amber also becomes curious about richards protestations of innocence and discovers he was framed guess what happens to her then so as amber richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers we soon become aware that richards is no ordinary cop hes super arnie the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in christmas lights all while being just your average american guy with an austrian accentyes the remainder of the film becomes dumb loud classic 80s arnie fun theres a lot of exciting fight sequences the trademark dreadful puns he had to split being my favourite and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending its a lot of fun watching killian react to it in the typical wholesome gameshow host way as well and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host watch out for the cursing old lady and the cold cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratingsif you expect a highbrow intelligent film youll be disappointed but if you want a great 80s flick well this is it but the great thing about this film is it was quite propheticif you look at the entertainment we have today youll have noticed the way reality tv is going nowadays shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on tv its not too far a leap to imagine that some vile tv exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on tv weve already had that however with the ghoulish alqaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet it seems that in the current climate at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television setswith that in mind and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s you have to be impressed by the farsightedness of this film of course we havent reached there yet as its terrorists rather than the mainstream media who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines peoples desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity,1,0,positive,
heftig og begeistret intense and enthusiastic is a documentarylike story of a male choir up in berlevg in the very northern part of norway where the weather is cold and hostile the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of norway where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunitiesthe most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves the people in the choir who are aged from 30 to 95 all have unique colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings they are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the north and have adapted to the way of living required throughout the movie we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs some events in a church and on the harbour and in the end a trip to murmanskthe outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the norwegian nature the scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet thei r livingrooms the bathroom the kettle on the oven there is nothing artificial about this movie not the people not the environment not their music and not their feelings everything is as real as can beit all loses out though when it comes to giving a story it is very beautiful and real but why do we see it is it because of the songs is it because of the nature or is it simply just to see a story about berlevg menschoir about their life and some of the trips they have the message if there is any is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir the choir have kept the people together for many many yearsit is all nice but being as popular as it has been seen by almost 200000 in norway there is something wrong there is no beginning or end to it nobody gains or loses anything nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great why was this movie madei am sorry it is a nice movie about good people but compared to the average european scandinavian or norwegian movie this does not deserve a 9 out of 10 it is closer to 4 out of 10 and that is what i will give itif you see this movie in a theater you should expect the average age on the audience to be around 5560 it has reported to be consistently high in all theaters maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the imdb it is a movie about elders for elders it is a movie of i regret nothing in my life and a story saying that living in a small town like berlevg might be a nice life too,0,1,positive,

mary pickford often stated that tess skinner was her favorite movie role well said she played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced she not only had to purchase the rights from adolph zukor but even give him credit on the films main title card needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning indeed in my opinion the movie itself rates as one the alltime great experiences of silent cinematrue director john s robertson doesnt move his camera an inch from start to finish but in robertsons skillful hands this affectation not only doesnt matter but is probably more effective a creative artist of the first rank robertson is a master of pace camera angles and montage he has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players jean hersholt who enacts the heavy is so hideously repulsive its hard to believe this is the same man as kindly dr christian while lloyd hughes renders one of the best acting jobs of his entire career true its probably not the way mrs white intended but it serves the plot admirably as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the dope spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to ascertain who actually fired the gun that killed his future brotherinlaw needless to say this particular quality of the likable hero is downplayed by jack ging in the bowdlerized 1960 version which also totally deletes the authors trenchant attack on smug middleclass christianity notice how the wellwashed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the interruption but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our plucky little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly ordained to administer this is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presentedtess also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress gloria hope whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema she married lloyd hughes in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children lloyd hughes died in 1958 but she lived until 1976 easily contactable in pasadena but i bet noone had the brains to interview her another opportunity lost to me forrest robinson only made a middling impression as skinner i thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this he usually played priests or judges but david torrence as usual was superbin all an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values,1,1,positive,

tempest is based on the classic shakespearean work of the same name but bears little resemblance to its source materialit masquerades as being as cerebral as its namesake but instead is a jumbled convoluted and hackneyed exercise in tedium the original probed the premise that people have an evil side which would be destructive if unchecked here you just get an uninteresting mid life crisis yawn goof ball who is having everything go wrong in his personal and professional life he becomes endowed with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment in other words to get his own wayevery few minutes after something else in his pathetic life goes wrong he finds a secluded place and starts babbling show me the magic while waving his hands around and making a serious concentration expression from the way these scenes are shot it looks like hes trying to turn bugs into other kinds of bugs turning a spider into a cockroach maybe but by this time you really dont carethe story has him bolt from his life with his daughter to a greek island somewhere then have a awkward relationship with some girl he meets one of the dullest romances ever committed to film the story just bogs down and moves at a slower and slower pace you are never given any reason to like or dislike anyoneill give this a 2 because of the beautiful greek location shots and the semioptimistic conclusion although it isnt clear if the tempest power brought this ending about or not the spirit of shakespeares work has been captured much better in other movies one notable example is forbidden planet which gave credence to how the power gets out of controlas for this tempest its only magic is to cure insomnia,0,-1,neutral,
the hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time this film produced by screenwriter paddy chayefsky who gave us the oscarwinning film network deals with overworked staff gross incompetence and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in manhattan george c scott in a superb performance as the head physician is driven to alcoholism and a deathwish as he tries to recover from a divorce throwing his son out of the house and worst of all a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injuredmr scott makes the movie his own and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment you can feel the pain pun intended of what this hospital has done to him the vivid images of this hospitals incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to sceneif only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out this picture would be brilliant unfortunately there is a subplot of scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient the patient has been murdering people at the hospital this is where credibility of the picture becomes strained the romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture and the mental patient posing as a doctor i found to be totally unbelievable a simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings it takes almost the whole movie before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital i could not see one person doing that much damage even as corrupt as this hospital isfurthermore george c scotts character is overworked another pun intended because the script has too many things happening at once for example within a period of 20 minutes you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didnt do with the nurses and aids its the same story someones chart was read wrong someone was given the wrong medication and died the doctor operated on the wrong patient than another doctor does the same thing blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break there is also a lot of subtle dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewerthis repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable however the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie when the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and scotts reactions to this you are glued to the screen but the conversations between scott and the mad patients daughter force the film into a mystery type who done it scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie when the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings i wondered the following why did the producers need the find the killer madpatient subplot i think the only point of scotts character having a relationship with the senile patients daughter was to give him anybody with whom to communicate the hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the loveinterest and mad patient scenes it should have focused on the incompetent bs within its walls more frequently in an era where this movie could have been phenomenal the subplot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been,1,1,positive,
first and foremost i take issue to the title of this movie chupacabra is not a spanish word the name to which they are referring is chupacabras i imagine they dropped the s because it sounds plural that way but i assure you it is singular in spanishnext i thought this movie had been done years ago it came off as one of those b horror flicks i watched when i was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town then it would have been kind of scarylets talk about the special effects the most important effect is the costume used for the chupacabras given that it is the main character you would think some serious money would have been put into it but that isnt so the shape color and texture were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at disney worldthere were times when the chupacabras was walking where no man could walk his movement were jerky and strange at these times but moving around on the floor looked like any normal mananother thing i take issue to is that there is no animal in the world that goes around slaughtering everything it sees with no regard to actually eating it the chupacrabas would kill one then the next but it never seemed to actually eat the victim you say its just a movie and i agree but the idea is so far out there that its stupidwhat country is dr pena from he sounds sort of jamaincanhawaiianbritishsomethingelse but i think hes supposed to be latino the problem is his accent is so bad that even a russian could tell he wasnt latinothe soldiers fired round after round at this thing and werent making a dent yet the continued to fire im no military man but dont soldiers especially the special tactical forces such as this have to have some wit about them to perform their duties wouldnt they figure out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new they didnt they just kept firing away while the chupacabras continued to slaughter and not eat themdid they have to kill the little dog anyway my vote was 3 for this flick because it was bad why did i watch the whole thing im sure youve done the same on occasion so dont give me an flack,0,0,negative,

i am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say the book was better i know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it wasnt a faithful adaptation there is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the directorseditorscinematographersproducers control and certainly out of the original authors control therefore it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same word for word as a book or play or video game or disneyland ride or whatever a movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society moreover a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and if it is based on source material its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers films like there will be blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century oil it feels relevant because of things like the iraq war and energy concerns that the films country of origin the us was and is experiencing even king kong based on the original film benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people havewith that said i just dont understand why they even bothered to make this movie besides the great performances guaranteed oscar nods and shanleys directorwriters fee and royalties he will get this movie seems to come from nowhere it should have simply stayed as a play the movie which is essentially the same as the play says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the catholic church here and abroad it says nothing new or different than the original play i cant help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time frostnixon which was also based on a play frostnixon while about nixons regrets seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when president bush was about to leave office the regrets that nixon had as depicted in the playmovie about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on bush and his presidency in that respect frostnixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time in contrast doubt felt like it was yesterdays news and didnt seem to offer anything that the play didnt offerof course the movie is good the performances are outstanding and the screenplay adaptation is apt but so what why didnt it just stay as a play why besides marketing and financial reasons make it into a movie it gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject,0,1,positive,

what an entertaining movie astaire and randolph scott are in the navy astaire has to woo back ginger in san francisco while scott must be persuaded that harriet hilliard is worthy of being his wife everything works out fineits sometimes argued and i can see why that scotts romance with hilliard is unnecessary and slows the plot down especially painful are hilliards singing of sappy love songs i could have done without her singing right enough but i found the romance rather touching hilliard enters the movie as a music teacher wearing a pair of spectacles no makeup and the ugliest clothes known to man or beast no wonder scott avoids her until she grooms herself sexily under the tutelage of her sister ginger and a slinky lucille ball the problem is that after her makeover she looks like the same irretrievably plain woman as before only with a glossier outfit its tough enough for a homely guy but at least a man can become wealthy and powerful and popular then he can collect women anyway even if he looks like jojo the dogfaced boy but what does a plainlooking woman do the same avenues to romance arent open to her henry kissinger had groupies did margaret thatcher it must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as ours as a kind of a footnote i must mention that randolph scott was rumored to be bisexual by hollywood gossips who needed some nonsense to chew on and its kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when hes putting homely hilliard off women dont interest me sister the movie probably gives more quality time to ginger rogers than any of her other films with astaire and shes marvelous shes beautiful sexy a talented actress and dancer and the script gives her good comic lines too lets kiss and make up suggests astaire lets just make up she says that will give you something to work on its also the only film she made with astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition choreographed by hermes pan her performance is accidentally sabotaged by astaire who slips some alka seltzer or something into her water and she hiccups through her number burping being too indelicate for the timeas a dancer id make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur but i think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film their first during a dancing contest let yourself go is the most wildly exuberant of any i can remember and the only dramatic duet lets face the music and dance must be among their finest the last step as they exit is startlingi like the film for reasons with personal resonance i remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown san diego next to a shop called the seven seas that catered to sailors i was in uniform at the time and was impressed with the treatment of the naval careers of astaire and scott what i mean is here we have this frothy musical comedy which owed absolutely nothing to historical reality and yet unlike most of their other teamings pays its dues anyway jumping ship astaire calls out for a water taxi i had just taken a water taxi ashore myself the uniforms are correct to the period unlike say those in on the town and theyre worn properly hats down to two fingerwidths above the eyebrow and not cocked back and there are two incidents in which astaire runs into a problem with naval authorities and theyre both handled with perfect seriousness and are thoroughly believable an officer stops astaire from leading a jazz band during inspection and reports to the captain they were playing when the call was sounded sir im certain no breach of discipline was intended its what an officer a good officer would say and nobody laughsthe series was getting a little repetitious by the time follow the fleet was made so instead of putting fred into high society and a tuxedo they turned him into a gumchewing swabbie instead it was a good idea and the dance numbers are up to the concept,1,0,positive,

i rented this film because of my interest in american history and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his vision into a major world religion it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo illinois it portrays the trial of joseph smith within the course of that trial brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith then smith is assassinated and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land despite his grave doubts he perseveres and finally has a vision that utah is the place for his colony that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership later as crops are destroyed by crickets he again doubts that he has truly been chosenhowever a miracle occurs which cements his place in historyi found the performances to be moving and the story to be convincing and interesting i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal polygamy is a part of the story but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised the issue is not emphasizedim sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subjectmatter but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout,1,1,positive,

boston blackie movies have some strengths mostly in that the pacing is swift and the hero is cheerfully unfazed in even the worst circumstances but the plotting is frequently atrocious and the unrelenting comic bits often kill the pacing if the plot happens to be atypically good or are just unfunny and inappropriatethis one involves blackie chasing an escapee from the asylum steve cochran in a really poor performance who has become fixated on beautiful nina foch who puts in a nice rather subtle acting job inspector farraday of course believes blackie has gone homicidal maniac he at least has some evidence in this one for that and is incompetently trying to jail him as blackie goes after the real killer the plot has possibilities but any time any real tension gets going we a get a not funny comedy routine it doesnt seem like anyone at columbia understood that in a movie about a pursuit of a really dangerous maniac cute little comedy scenes about hiding an inconvenient body from the inspector disrupt any willing suspension of disbelief one just concludes our clever hero is an idiot deadly for a film like this this one is not worth the time for a well plotted episode of this series see alias boston blackie,0,0,negative,
once again i must play something of the contrarian most of the reviews for ab tak chappan have been extremely positive mine is positive but only slightly a 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a c letter grade from meit seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors one that ab tak chappan is more realistic than the typical bollywood film and two that it is trying to do things differentlythe first point i couldnt care less about im not looking for realism in films and so i do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how i believe the real world to beim a big fan of surrealism fantasy absurdism and so on although i do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that theyre realistfor the second point i agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently however i dont think originality versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself a film can be original and poor just like a film can be formulaic and excellent what matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewerab tak chappan is based on the true story of a mumbai cop named daya naik naik was an encounter specialist encounter specialists who could be said to be early instantiations of real world judge dredds are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue and theyre basically given a license to killeffectively acting as policeman judge jury and executioner in a matter of moments ab tak chappan follows the story of sadhu agashe nana patekar the encounter specialist based on naik we see him at work interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence we see him at home trying to live a normal life in his lessthanluxurious surroundings we see him trying to adjust to a new commissioner halfway through the film and we see his odd relationship with a notorious indian gangster don zameer zafar prasad purandhareall of this has the potential to make a fabulous gritty film i agree that its nice to forgo the typical bollywood musical numbers and romancesnot every film needs that stuff ab tak chappan producer ram gopal varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that hes directed or produced additionally ab tak chappan has some good performancespatekar almost gives off a death wish 1974era charles bronson vibe it also has admirable cinematographythe handheld stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective for example it has a great score that mixes more of a moody hollywoodsounding actioncrime score with traditional indian instruments and modalities the violence is well done and grittythere is also decent exploration of subtexts including the morality of having encounter specialists the idea of following orders and so on the encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong more poignantly the film questions the merit of blindly following orders parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and say members of a countrys military and were shown what a corrupt situation this can lead tobut you just knew there was a but coming didnt you director shimit amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters far too much sprawl and that moves a bit too slow all of these problems may be due to amin and crew looking at the godfather films which ab tak chappan has some at least superficial resemblances to although from a policemans perspectivemost of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very wellthese are shallowly drawn characters to say the least except for agashe and jatin shukla nakul vaid for one narayan i didnt know who he was until at least halfway through the film his name is mentioned a number of times but id only get glimpses of him until the scene would change then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and id have to start all over figuring out who narayan wasthe same thing happened with agashes first commissioner the film was already far into the new commissioner before i could figure out the relationships it seems like there are new characters in every scene we never learn the stories of most of them while that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about because theyre mostly doing so on orders since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists either its difficult to find characters to care about and that doesnt exactly make for a gripping filmthe primary villain is zameer but until about halfway through the film theres no indication of this he doesnt get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film and hes literally phoning his performance inhes in another location dubai communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film we dont actually see zameer doing much to an extent the film depends on a couple twists that necessitate not showing zameer doing a number of things but we could see him do other things and a lot of the other villains could have been left outthat would have tightened up the film a bit making it more focused and about a halfhour shorter both of which would have benefited its impact this is not an actionpacked film by any means for at least the first 45 minutes or so i found myself admiring ab tak chappans considerable style but saying okay get on with the story

the movie started off ok a couple of tourists on vacation in mexico having a good time decide they should go on a hike they uncover some hidden trails and end up and this huge temple like fortress angry villagers show up and try to deter them from climbing it but because of the language barrier people get shot and the tourists end up climbing the stupid thing turns out the plants are evil bloodthirsty things that the villagers wont go near so they guard the temple so the tourists cant get off there are a couple of scares in this movie but nothing really makes sense i mean theyre plants dont bother buying or renting the dvd wait till it comes out on cable,0,-1,negative,
lets see where to begin bad acting im not sure if id even call it that as it more along the lines of a noeffort script read the actors didnt even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldnt save this movie from its lifeless charactersto call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rantsbudget did this movie even have a budget it seemed like they used less money than ive seen in a homeshot youtube video bad lighting props poor sound post production bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick i dont care who directed itive seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom dont waste your time or youll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review check the ratings youll see the 1s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10s with hardly anything in between wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time what a suckfest,0,0,negative,
i enjoyed this one because i can relate to it at one time in my life i was trying to make films and experienced many of the same problems mark borchardt did in trying to make his film and i also went through a protracted period of selfabsorbed arrested development where i refused to grow but then miraculously i got married and had kids i realized that being a struggling filmmaker was in all likelihood not going to feed my family so i got a decent job and did what i felt i needed to do to make that happen that is what an mature responsible adult does mark hasnt faced up to that reality as yet and so in that sense he is a retarded adolescent for this reason there is a hopelessness about him like don quixote he seems so inept and selfdeluded that he doesnt realize how bad off he really is the viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle mark has kids and an exwife and bills to pay but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his artistic vision despite this mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends unfortunately mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career maturity responsibility education knowledge life experience prioritization financial clout etc yet he trudges on much like ed wood apparently without any semblance of a clue i guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the never say die attitude of this noble individual struggling against the odds and man what odds there are kiefer sutherland colin hanks tori spelling and angelina jolie are all offspring of bigtime film or tv people no doubt they will all want to direct some day if they arent already how much room is there for an independent like mark its like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board over and over again come to think of it that is pretty close to what happens to one of marks actors with the kitchen cabinet door in one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in any moviedespite these misgivings and seeming criticisms i truly enjoyed this movie and would heartily recommend it to anyone uncle bill is amazing i have a friend who met both mike and mark and he told me that in real life these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie,1,-1,positive,
much more than any other film from that period night of the demons represents the brainless and hugely enjoyable horror pastiche its undemanding fun with loads of nasty makeup effects gorgeous looking and horny teenagers and adorable clichelements a group of party animals led by the alternative angela goes to celebrate halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an eerie urban legend it all starts out typical and innocent with dancing drinking and the occasional flirt between youngsters that cant keep their hormones under control but pretty soon a bloodthirsty demon possesses the hostess in the most ingenious ways youve ever seen the rest of the cast gets slaughtered viciously only to return as hideous creatures prowling for blood the thing that makes this film better than most cheesy 80s horror films is finds a good balance between lightheaded camp and atmospheric horror some sequences really are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies night of the demons with an excellent tone director tenney makes great use of the set pieces coffins a crematorium endless dark hallways and his young enthusiast cast obviously love what theyre involved in the terrific makeup effects by a whole team of artists and designers are of course the obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics will absolutely love the large amount of severed limbs poked out eyes and crushed skulls the ultimate highlight however is linnea quigleys trick with the disappearing lipstick this nymphomaniac bimbo shoves an entire tube of lipstick in her nipple and continues her sexual murder spree terrific night of the demons received two sequels during the 90s and although theyre still definitely worth checking out they focus more on comedy than chills,1,1,positive,
at least with the teenage geek gets the girl films the guy is usually unpopular with girls in the 40 year old virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin but then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did i miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 yearsone of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them i find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent tv comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs theyve done the gross out movies theyve done the lets act like all americans have a mental age of 15 where will they go next this film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it,0,1,positive,

even if it wont give one more than previous posts here like ruby liangs very good one i wanted to share my own point of view hope my english is understandablebon voyage is a rhythmic light but deep presentation of the french unorganized comedown but also courage and charm all along in a brilliantly reconstituted 1940 france with many details from bordeaux luxurious hotel occupied by government hq and attacked by useless high class french to parisian coffees near le pantheon rue mouffetard and 1930s cars grard depardieu and yvan attal give their second roles a brilliant taste isabelle adjani and virgnie ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles and grgori derangre makes an bewitching performancemuch lighter than average eg american war times movies and focused on the civilians bon voyage shows a lot of things about french issues even to a french guy like me some of them quite deep,1,1,positive,
i think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best national lampoons films it also has a very catchy spoof title which basically sums up what the whole movie is about men in white the story is a spoof of many films including a will smith film as you might have guessed men in black i will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny leslie nielsen style humour from start to finish especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins garbage cans also they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry garbage collecting truck in that scene too the acting is not superb actually it is not very good but that is what makes the film funny it is a comedy loosen up i love the story line partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle or should it be unsubtle they rip off all the other films i am great fan of unserious spoof films but i am also a fan of the real thing and with this films it is hard to decide which is better the film it mainly rips off mentioned earlier i this review or the actual film it is but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films it actually makes it even harder but this film carries it off successfully the two garbage men are so funny it reminds me of a tv sketch show in the uk called little britain this film is a must for your collection and is one of the best most entertaining funniest best storyline national lampoons film to date,1,1,positive,
spectacular horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it the atmosphere is very creepy and stylish the score is chilling but the best about the movie is its performances its rare to get scared by performances and this movies solid acting plays an important part in the scare factorthe story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes though the woman in black does not have much screen time she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes the dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and thats when it becomes really scary if you have the chance watch this on theater its a totally different experience but as scary as this moviethis is one of the best ghost movies ever and its directed for people that want to get scared,1,1,positive,
this was a romantic simple funny movie i really enjoyed it and would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it will smith was funny fumbly nervous sweet and just a simple guy who got hit by love it was cute to see him fall for someone and be so nervous and lost as to what to do or say it was great he was great funny as usual eva mendes was better than i expected her to be as well i thought there were moments in the movie where will got the shaft he was doing everything he could being a good guy and still getting treated bad the ending was romantic and happy and it was great i have seen it several times and would watch it again a funny movie something you dont see a lot of anymore it had the old time feel with a fresh new look,1,-1,positive,
but you probably have seen it or else you wouldnt be here its so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like i did because this little known gem receives no wordofmouthfrom the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but dont look in the basement plays it subtle which makes for superior suspense note to horror filmmakers some of us do like subtlety lovely and homely nurse charlotte takes a job at a sanitarium but is dismayed when she learns that the head doctor who hired her had a gruesome accident and she is now the subordinate to a mysterious doctor who we all know isnt a doctor at all the suspense is built through charlottes unraveling of events with assistance from many of the patients but which of the patients can charlotte trust this is a gem and is my absolute favorite true horror movie i love reanimator and evil dead but they play more for the horrorcomedy crowdviolence quite tame for horror standards but there is a decent sprinkling of gore throughout the film the opening scene is classic no other horror film starts out better and the end has its fair share of gore as wellnudity eager to fall in love allyson betty chandler spends a good deal of time naked attempting to seduce half the men at the sanitarium betty chandler is a knockout and i am shocked that this is her only film creditstory the story is well handled despite the premise getting a lot of mileage in hollywood the script has a knack for building suspense and never fails to place poor charlotte in a precarious situationacting betty chandler does the best job here as allyson capturing dementia with naivet in an ethereal form the judge was splendid as well weighing facts before he came to a verdict while rosie holotik as charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for her character,1,0,positive,
although it strays away from the book a little you cant help but love the atmospheric music and settingsthe scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside i like the scene where they are in the hot baths but did the men and women really bathe together like that you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful i especially liked catherines dress in the first ballroom scenenorthanger abbey looked suitably imposing but i enjoyed the bath scenes betterschlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feelugh peter firth as mr tilney he just talks a load of rubbish and is not a clergyman as he should be its hard to think of him being in love with catherine but then the book never really gave that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably well by hardy and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney as for john thorpe well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but i quite like iti can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me the marchioness i hate her she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boysome of the script is peculiar when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks i suppose you saw the body how did it appear what a silly thing to say elinors calm response is stupid tooanyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me,1,-1,positive,
if you are one of those people that think lucio fulci is all about gore guts and zombies you have to watch this and the psychic too for that matter even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence and a unsettling subject matter its not the main thing here this is a truly impressive story and characterdriven murder mystery that might well be the directors masterpiece here he proves that hes a real craftsman creating a memorable disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece filled with creepy catholic imagery and interesting social commentary it also has a great cast including the gorgeous barbara bouchet as well as tomas millan from beatrice cenci and irene pappas in a small but important role still it is brazilian actress florinda bolkan who also stared in fulcis bizarre lizard in a womans skin who steals the scene in the role of majara giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her superstitions and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking the second star of the movie is sergio dofizis cinematography who along with the melancholic morriconeesquire score by riz ortolani help bringing the secluded italian village with a dark secret setting to life i have to admit thought that the dummy head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off but nonetheless this is a definite italian horror classic a moving sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius 1010 for me if you liked this one i recommend watching alfred soles alice sweet alice as they are somewhat similar and are both underrated gems,1,1,positive,
the first time i watched cold case was after it had run for about a year on danish television at the time it came to the tv it nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other american crime shows aired roughly the same timei saw it and i was bored to death the substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind the entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back 102030 or even 60 years seems so unlikelythe time is also a factor as they only have 5060 min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members if they are still alive this combined with the personal problems and relations of the investigators which there has to be time for leaves the show a complete lacklusteri give it a 2star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching itwhich you then of course wont do as that is too lame a reason for watching this crap,0,-1,neutral,

this begrudging and angry film is against not just the war during which it was made but all war it doesnt care what war it is it might be the most emotionally involving experience i have ever had with ingmar bergmans work there are no sides to the two main characters in this impacting drama which doesnt intimate a point in any ceremonial symbolism as per bergmans usual but plainly showcases people and their lives and exercises what bergman has already proved he understands about a persons reaction to a moviehis topdrawer regulars liv ullmann and max von sydow play an internalizing but bickering married couple who were once orchestra musicians now they live in a weathered farm house on an island part of the building frustration we grow to share with these two people fertilizes in the detail that nothing in their house seems to work they are not reclusive intellectuals either they are a rather familiar marriage that has more or less resigned from life and is essentially apolitical they only get wind of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever ullmann is concerned with the danger to their lives and to her desire to bear children her husband von sydow shrugs off that the war will pass them by their serenity is interrupted by screaming fighter planes flying low over their house the killing of a parachuting airman the arrival of dubious troops their inquisition and eventually their capture by what appears to be the local side but loyalties have long since splintered they are sent back to their home witness gratuitous destruction and suffer the vindictive consequences of such an agonizingly distrustful marriage this one of my top favorite bergman efforts is a study of a couple jarred from their safely selfunaware lives and violated by a manipulative despair testing them both to reveal who they really are she lacks compassion to some extent too selfserving and restless to have any patience for his capricious breakdowns into crying his suppressed emotional issues have led to the repression of the very initiative and excitement that attracted them to begin with the immense last twenty minutes sporadically interrupted by images of the overwhelming gray sky are among the closest to real emotion that bergman ever filmedall systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists in this very essential and downbeat portrait the basically clearcut personalities of ullmann and von sydows characters are hurled into the degenerate world of war because they are accused of being sympathizers but the film shot on bergmans small home island of faro doesnt give any information about where or when its set who the two sides are and for what theyre fighting to an uninvolved civilian caught in between the knowledge base is likely to be quite similarullmann and von sydow are not sympathizers for the apparent enemy but theyre partisans for who are apparently their side this 1968 reactive allegory could be about the common noncombatant citizens of iraq or kosovo or vietnam or israel or palestine or,1,-1,neutral,

if youve got a box of tissues a comfy couch a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a friday night this is definitely your movie its romantic its hot and its challenging for most of us gay people religion is just one of those things that we did when we were kids and probably just starred at the alter boy and how cute he was but in latter days you see the struggles of being gay when your entire world revolves around beliefs which totally contradict being gay the two main cast members were totally hot but at the same time managed to capture your heart and even make me almost cry i have never cried in a movie which i thought was quite impressive for a b grade movie i highly recommend this flick you will laugh you will cry unless your me and you will definitely drool i love it so much i even purchased the dvd for my collection its truly the most beautiful movie ever,1,-1,positive,

i agree with another reviewer this is such a shattering film that will be tough to watch again soon though for quality alone it deserves repeated viewing the complexity of the characters the incredible cinematography and superb direction make this movie worth the emotional price of watchingthere is one scene of the two partisans dragging themselves through the snow to escape a patrol thats perhaps for sheer physicality the most amazing performance ive ever seen in fact though not episodic the story flows this is a movie of memorable scenes theres the passing of rations amongst the partisans the snow scenes the ruined farm scene the encounters in the houses the interrogation the basement scene the ascent all stand out like jewels in a necklacefor me the religiosity isnt overt frankly i dont think it would have been permitted in a soviet film i do see this as an existential parable about the value of life here is a tale where the hero and he is a true hero becomes the villain and the weaker one becomes the stronger one is this a mystical process or one dictated by circumstances there is a transfiguration but does it come from within or without you must see the movie to understand the issues for they cant be discussed without giving away too much of the story i cant say enough about the acting its hard for me to choose which of the leads is more affecting im not familiar with soviet film of the 70s and am not familiar with any of the actors but they are all superb i also note how director larisa shepitko uses children they remind me of giottos child angelsthere is a little muddling in the end there is apparently a prior relationship between the soldier sotnikov and the interrogator portnov but this is left dangling and the final scene is a bit ambiguous but compared to the total experience these are quibbles this is a movie that will mark you for life,1,1,positive,

the title is from a passage in the bible deut 2828 lets just say it is taken horribly out of context but nonetheless that is where the title of this agonizing movie originates the other reviewers cover the plot details so i wont rehash but the husband who is a psychiatrist delivers a lecture on inferior function where he discusses how a person can meet another another person and they can experience a cataclysmic crisis in their lives where they cease to be masters of themselves and incapable of fair judgement he is saying this at the podium at the exact moment as he lays eyes on leonora vail in the audience the woman who will become his mistress not very subtle for showing that this is indeed what will happen to this poor mani think the whole premise of the movie is implausible and just didnt work here is an overthehill psychiatrist and we are to believe this young beautiful woman falls for him and comes between the happiness he and his wife shared whats even more implausible is how the betrayed wife responds when she learns of the infidelity not only is she understanding but she insists her husband embark on a several month vacation with the tramp so we all can get a little relief from this unbearable stress give me a break i wanted to reach through the screen and throttle not just the adulterer but the dimwit wifethe fact that the whole movie takes place as a flashback after already revealing the end of the movie at the beginning the fact that the husband had a terrible accident it leaves no doubt as to the outcome of the sordid affair i think this was a poor decision as it leaves absolutely no plot twists to look forward to as the whole movie is completely predictable you already know the wifes resignation to the affair at the beginning of the film as she summons the mistress to the dying mans bedside and expresses no ill will towards hernot only is the script defective but noel coward is horribly miscast even though it is his screenplay he and leonora have absolutely no chemistry on screen whatsoever its interesting that michael redgrave was originally cast in that role but was replaced during filming i wonder what that was about in the end neither the husband or the wife cause you to feel any sympathy for either one of them i do think margaret leighton played the part of strumpet quite well but she couldnt possibly overcome all the negatives this film had also as is the case of many british productions of this era the dialogue is hard to understand due to the clipped fast speech pattern of the actors i saw it on tv and couldnt even rely on closed captioning to fill in the blanks for medont waste your time on this one,0,0,negative,

this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time jonny kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love watching minutes of his life long struggle was heartwrenching listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming and seeing him smile was indescribable i feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant please if you ever have a chance to watch this film consider yourself lucky to have met jonny kennedy,1,-1,positive,
if you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about 5 minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script wannabe actors an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomedi rented this once and i swear i got stupider watching it if you are a humanitarian buy this horrible horrible movie and burn itunwatched as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative 10 stars,0,0,negative,
i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to itslow moving bad dialogue lots o bloodbut this was worse than anything i could have imagined the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters dont have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic bookwith the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it wasnt that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out,0,0,positive,

the ruth snyder judd gray murder in 1927 inspired ogden nash to write a broadway play called machinal more famously it inspired james m cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with double indemnity and the postman always rings twice both became film noir classics of the 1940s double indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made some of the reallife elements of the snydergray story were captured by cain the old age and indifference of albert gray ruths high sex drive ruth and judds passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban manhattan albert snyder being a respected newspaper editor the numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chasecains double indemnity was filmed perfectly by billy wilder lets ignore stanwycks ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore the postman always rings twice however was filmed thrice and ossessione an italian version and luchino viscontis first film was the first of three versions before commenting on it ill recommend the lana turner john garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 jack nicholson jessica lange version for the great sex scene on the dining tableossessione is not as noirish as the postman always rings twice it has a strong neorealist look which makes it a great movie but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing it does not have lowkey lighting and unconventional camera angles the dialog is not hardboiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization this is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization its also a lot more sexual than the lana turner version we have a very obvious adulterous relationship and giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac a new character is introduced into the story la spagnola with very obvious homosexual overtones there is also a small but very wellplayed role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitutethis is a far greater study of the working class than of crime the audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime the drifter is a complete tramp the wife is no lana turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage her husband is an obscene capitalist obese rude and arrogant i think the casting was brilliant for this film my only beef is with the overlong running time everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical nevertheless fans of noir and realism will definitely like ossessione as i did,1,1,positive,
i watched the unaired episodes online and i was so sad that the show wont be back it had the best cast of mature talented actors and an amazing chemistry it seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life towards the end the show became engaging sexy and highly watchable of course some of the story lines are not realistic so what the characters are all likable and you root for them the show reminded me a cross between 2 other favorites sex and the city and felicity big kudos to all the cast note to abc execs nielsen ratings reports do not show you true results the show audience will mostly record it ive been very disappointed with major networks for flooding us with realitytv or teenage oriented shows why to get a mature thoughtful wellacted material we have to switch to hbo or fx i can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online the new stream media will gain more and more popularity among viewers,1,1,positive,
sorry if i disappoint anyone about what i am about to say to this made for tv movie but i paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster the directing is really awfully bad but after i looked up its information here i realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing maybe they dont have budget but anyway ang lees sense and sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit the director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldnt even keep up a rational continuity in itself it keeps pulling me outta scenes maybe someone need to work hard on story line board the dubbed sound is also awfully bad my god normally i would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual but this time i am just mad i really wanna hit something hard just dont do the job if someone cant fulfill it to its best bad arts its not even art what is it really hurt people,0,0,positive,

creep is the story of kate potente an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station after somehow meeting workmate and wouldbe rapist guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the citys streets her story is linked to that of george blackwood an excon working in the sewer system they meet in the final third of the film brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues themthe pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations from the tube station they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery most tube stations dont have toilets so how one has a surgery is beyond me naturally the film cares to explain that the surgery doesnt have running water yet it has electricity just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to createthe monster itself is a problem theres a complete lack of reasoning for its actions it just kills people for no obvious reason and then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time i understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son and a few shots of some jars containing babies and yes it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds it also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak communicating only in raptor screams but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay hmmthis doctor business leads to scene that is the films desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch it just isnt enough the final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason george breaks down unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again and kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard yeahafter starting out as a this could happen to anyone movie it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic a complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid,0,-1,neutral,
i saw this film on 19sep2009 at the cambridge film festival the beagles only in a couple of short flashbacks the whole thing is about darwins life from 1841 to 1859 when he was ensconced in kent with his growing family 200 pages of origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book the script is based on randal keyness book annies box annie charless daughter died when she was 10 it is mostly a family drama but does include sex scenes however the participants are married both on and off screen not too exciting not much science but a wellmade film thats pleasant to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons a bit of a romantic weepie actually i suppose the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic freethinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father some of the characters and darwin himself state or wonder whether he killed god but the viewer is able to doubt that what is beyond doubt given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation on the meadowbank wellknown before darwin and completely uncontroversial and the failure of darwins prayers is that the idea of a kind providential god who loves his creatures is untenable i really cannot see many americans objecting to it very much some may have problems with the title which is probably the most controversial thing about the film or with the fact that bettany does not have horns a tail and a pitchfork,1,1,positive,

admittedly parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone although it is a favourite of mine knappertsbusch 1951 in particular syberbergs entire approach is so static whenever the music suddenly begins to swell syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace the takes on amfortas and klingsor are endless whatever happened to film editing the result is physically exhausting to watch the viewer is never spiritually transported your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that wagner got it right syberberg got it wrong and that set decoration with those clever reminders of wagners antisemitism will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of wagner,0,-1,negative,
this is a powerful film which seems to have never rearisen after the joe mccarthy censorship period it influenced me as a jewish teenager who had friends of various colors and whose fathers family had suffered under the fascist regimes in europe during the second quarter of the twentieth century unlike the later ripoff on the waterfront which seemed to take some of the same themes and twist them to fit the enforced hollywood political correctness of the time it told its story direct and with respect for the characters and for the reality it fictionally reflected it was an antidote to gone with the wind birth of a nation triumph of the will and so many other glorifiers of hatred and violence i would place it alongside the recent german film also virtually hidden in the us rosenstrassei remember that the tv version also black and white in format as well as story was blacked out by some stations because the black heros wife appeared white as a young civil rights worker it produced a conflict for me because on the one hand i was opposed to smoking cigarettes and on the other opposed the boycott in georgia of a sponsor of the tv show a major tobacco company i no longer remember which one does anyone elsei would love to find a cd of either the film or the tv show to let my sons see something that informed my opposition to racism universally as opposed to only fighting racism against jews and recognition of the inherent connection between racism and militarism,1,-1,positive,

this little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails because it was a little picture john ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs he was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way he was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes some of them such as ben johnson had been discovered by ford and given opportunity to show their talents johnson was recruited by ford because he was an authentic cowboy from oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work years later he would win the coveted academy award for his brilliant performance in the last picture show ward bond even outshines ben johnson in this movie he is not the wagon master that role is played by johnson but because of this movie he was later given the role of wagon master in the classic television series wagon train ironically one of the bad guys in wagon master james arness would star in the hit television series gunsmoke on a rival network to wagon train ward bond plays the leader of the mormons heading west who often backslides to his sinning days by cussing only to be called down by fellow mormon adam perkins russell simpson when any bothersome situation arises elder wiggs ward bond yells blow your horn sister ledeyard the mormon sister played to perfection by jane darwell then blows so hard and loud that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound darwell and simpson were famous for playing ma and pa joad in fords classic version of the john steinbeck novel the grapes of wrathanother of the great character actors in fords company was hank worden who plays one of uncle shiloh cleggs notoriously mean but not too bright outlaw sons worden would become famous a few years later for playing mose in fords the searchers worden lived to be 91 he was still making movies when he diedthe wagon master travis blue ben johnson and his partner sandy harry carey jr are horse traders who never take their job seriously having a lot of fun along the way especially with the local sheriff they get mixed up with a mormon wagon train heading west fords beloved monument valley is the setting for most of the film the main reason for the teaming is a redheaded mormon beauty prudence perkins kathleen omalley who catches sandys eye along the way the train picks up a hoochie coochie show which includes a charlatan doctor alan mowbray and two soiled angels joanne dru and ruth clifford also joining up along the way is the clegg family wanted for murder and armed robbery ford shows how arduous a journey west by wagon was in those days the songs in the film were written by stan jones of the legendary sons of the pioneers jones writing was almost as good as that of bob nolan who had previously done much of the writing for the group jones most famous song not in this film is the much recorded ghost riders in the sky the sons of the pioneers do the background singing in wagon master this adds to the overall impact of wagons rolling westit should also be noted that the acclaimed native american athlete jim thorpe from oklahoma plays the role of a navajo leader this was his last film appearance he died not long after wagon master was released,1,1,positive,

when this was released i thought this was one of the most profane films ever made however thanks to martin scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him there have been mainline films worse languagewise than thisbut this is a pretty brutal assault on ones ears hey i can take a lot of it but this got ridiculous in the first six minutes alone i heard a halfdozen usages of the lords name in vain plus an untold number of fwords i wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990 i couldnt have been the only onenot surprisingly some of the feature actors included jennifer jasonleigh burt young jerry orbach and rikki lake since this film stephen lang seems to have improved his image at least playing the godly stonewall jackson in gods and generals langs role here is just the opposite perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the filmdepressing gloomy semipornographic repulsive these are just a few of the adjectives people used even some liberal critics in describing this story which is painted even worse in the novel of course some of the betterknown critics all extreme libs praised the movie however they were the only ones most critics were disgusted as well almost all of the paying public its unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like thistrust me on this there are no good likable characters in this entire movie this is a mean sick film one of the worst of the modern era that is unless you enjoy seeing child abuse drug abuse teen prostitutes on and on two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people no thanks,0,0,positive,

i recently rented this promising mini series i didnt even know they had adapted it for television i was really looking forward to it since the book icon is one of the best spy thrillers i have ever read what a disappointment it was the plot only loosely resembles the one in the book the characters are completely miscast and theres some appalling acting a shame really the story behind icon is perfect for the silver screen but i think television budgets just arent big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular bookforsyth deserves much much better than this avoid and stick to the book which is a mustread,0,-1,positive,
i thought this movie was highly underrated the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange and i was put off at first but once i was watching the movie it didnt seem strange at all i was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer and i couldnt wait to find out how it would end once it did endi thought about it for a long time after i was pleased with everything about kpax from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues to the ending its not an especially upbeat or happy film though it does make you chuckle from time to time but i found it to be especially entertaining and thoughtprovoking i own it now and intend to watch it many times,1,-1,neutral,
i have seen a lot of bad films most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is but this really takes badness to new extremesit is bland the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it there are no shocks no horror no suspense just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finisha blight on the crappy horror genre avoid at all costs,0,0,negative,
poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy tired of the hollywood glamor treatment first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress and now its europa 51 another tedious exercise in soggy sentimentnor does the story do much for alexander knox in another thankless role as her longsuffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than strombolibergman is still attractive here but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman shes never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a kindly male friend sometimes i think im going out of my mind she tells her husband a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace but it does give us a sense of where the story is goingbergman is soon motivated to help the poor in postwar rome but being a social worker with poor children doesnt improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worsethe films overall effect is that its not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that shes twotiming him the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a streetwalker through her terminal illness the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylumingrid suffers nobly through it all overcompensating for the loss of her son but its no use not one of her best flicks to put it mildlytrivia note if she wanted neorealism with mental illness she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak it would have done more for her career than europa 51summing up another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman,0,0,positive,
i just went to a screening of the film during expresion en corto a short film festival in guanajuato mexico one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed one long continuous shot of a futuristic paris in glorious black and whitei shouldnt go on with the details cause i think it is a film worth seeing the scifi story might be found average for many to me was really good the action is great the camera is free to fly everywhere and i mean everywhere things you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully the cast performance is good in my opinion no one hits the wrong notenow the thing that i found awesome is the animation 3d grafics look 2d a bw comic book brought to life the details on the backgrounds gives more texture as if it had been done by hand im sure it was but when the angles change you see the depth the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film 7 years the director she said is brilliant but perhaps he was quite unexperienced since he only had one short film in his cv so many people had true faith in them they started their own studio from scratch and ever since they faced the challenge they brought upon themdont miss it i think you wont regret it maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film is superior to his i think,1,1,positive,
i have to tell you ive been a fan of star trek tng since i was a kidwell sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some ds9 episodes and i asked himhey man what are you watching lately because im done watching all tng episodes he said well i got these episodes of farscape i said ok let me try it i was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just finised watching tng and found it greati had 3 episodes viewed those but the show didnt impressed me very much i found it childish initially and i thought its just another tv show nice adventures but regular music was a little bit different neat special effects though and i had the vague impression that the actors didnt fully get into the characters skini watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide i like or not since then the show started to get me i got a good grasp of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor crichtonthe rest is history i think i mostly like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action unlike star trek where everybody slept when they were supposed to do and way too much high tech bullshit the show got better with each episode very interesting story linewhat can i say this movie its like poetry i highly recommend it,1,-1,positive,
when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess2008 but when i saw the first 30 minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldnt just be a solid movie almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shotthe only thing that really let me down are the performances emily bluntthe devil wears prada is the star of the film bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettableto me the film feels like unfinished maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script i dont know but thats how i feel about the moviebut overall its a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt,1,1,positive,
samuel fuller is an interesting filmmaker mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films while shock corridor and the naked kiss represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of america and the big red one was an effective portrait of the horrors of war merrills marauders painted war as necessary hell and pickup on south street is about the dangers of communist spies all of his films make for very entertaining viewing and even though he was often pigeonholed as a bfilmmaker fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors pickup on south street is no exception and despite the dated themes the filmmaking style is remarkably ahead of its time its also a very quicklypace tight and occasionally brutal film noirthe acting across the board is fantastic richard widmark makes for a great antihero and jean peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend the show stealer is thlema ritter however in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie the angles fuller employs are great making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal this is very violent for its time the camera continuously moves around just as tarantino and his school would do forty years later pickup on south street is a great actionpaced noir thriller shock corridor remains my favorite fuller film but this is a very close second 810,1,1,positive,
it got to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any cartwright men after all ben cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage and any woman who got involved with adam hoss and little joe were going to end up dying because we couldnt get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv westernperhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the cartwrights people have relationships some go good some not so good its just life and were less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we dont have to kill the character off to keep the survivors nobility intact but thats if bonanza were done todaybut we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped the secret of bonanzas success was the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart sons ben cartwright was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three children the kids were all different in personality but all came together in a pinchthe cartwrights became and still are an american institution i daresay more people cared about this family than the kennedys just the popularity that bonanza has in syndication testifies to that pernell roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show rumor has it he didnt care for the noble cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious perhaps if it were done now hed have liked it better in the way i describethis was just the beginning for michael landon how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit landon also has highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he had creative control little joe was the youngest most hot headed but the most romantic of the cartwrights when roberts left the show kept going with the two younger sons but when big dan blocker left the heart went out of bonanza other characters had been added on by that time david canary tim matheson and ben cartwright adopted young mitch vogel but big loyal but a little thick hoss was easily the most lovable of the cartwrights his sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that familyso the cartwrights of the ponderosa have passed into history i got a real taste of how america took the cartwrights to heart when i visited the real virginia city it doesnt look anything like what you see in bonanza but near lake tahoe just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credits is the cartwright home the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction like 21 baker street for sherlock holmes fans the ranchhouse and the cartwrights are realand if they werent real they should have been,1,-1,neutral,

this is your standard musical comedy from the 30s with a big plus that it features some well known 30s actors in small fun cameosthere is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and noworries overall kind of atmosphere with a typical hal roach comedy touch to it appereantly its a cinderella story but i most certainly didnt thought of it that way while watching the movie the story gets very muddled in into the storytelling that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance when the main characters hit the hollywood studiosof course the highlight of the movie is when laurel hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines its like watching a movie and getting a laurel hardy short with it for free also laurel hardy regular walter long makes an appearance in the routine and james finlayson without a mustache this time as the director of the shortits certainly true that all of the cameos and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main characterthe movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period though the rating on here would suggest otherwise710,1,-1,neutral,

one life stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasnt been given the credit it deserves its imdb rating of 17 doesnt do it justice and is perhaps due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself shot on digital in black and white the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget the performances are excellent particularly that of gary lewis who gets better with every role my only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments overall though it is a fine piece of work,1,1,positive,
this is another of eastwoods many movies mixing intrigue action and a dollop of romance along with the gauntlet firefox and so forth clints acting range by now is pretty familiar in this one hes taciturn and a bit outrageous especially with women and superiors there are no surprises in his performance but the film itself is something of a surprise its above average clint is frank a secret service agent who perhaps in a moment of doubt failed to catch the bullet that killed jfk he then took to drink which drove his family away and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by john malkovitch calling himself booth who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability now this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like clint to project but he does rather well less robotic than usual and he does seem to carry around with him like a burden of stone the memory of that moment in dallas hes tested again halfway through this movie he is hanging from the roof of a tall building grasping booths hand and he pulls his pistol and points it at booth who asks him if he is really willing to shoot if he does of course he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a ciatrained murderer but he does so at the cost of his own life booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair and clint even has a short speech talking to renee russo about his failure to save the president in dallas if id have reacted quickly enough i could have taken that shot and that would have been alright with me its underplayed but his voice chokes slightly his eyes water and his lip trembles its one of the few scenes in any of clints films that might properly be called moving we know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time the irony is that he doesnt like the current president who could he gives pompous speeches in colorado about how they carved a nation out of the wilderness didnt they do the same thing in las vegasits often said that a movie is only as good as its villain it isnt true nothing is that simple but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case the reptilian john malkovitch with his tartar eyes is marveloustalk about disillusioned okay he can ham it up a little sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes but hes fascinating on the screen renee russo has little do to fred thompson as the chief white house aid is now back in politics a relief for moviegoers if clints acting range is limited thompsons is something less in every film hes been in he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorderthe direction by wolfgang peterson is as good as it was in das boot which is pretty good there is a great deal of the usual suspenseful crosscutting in the final shootout and when clint and russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor not only the usual garments but handcuffs guns beepers palm pilots dick tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta interrupted clint lies back on the bed and sighs now i have to put all that stuff back on againwell written and worth watching,1,1,positive,

hg wells is spinning no doubt about itreally this would have been a decent scifiadventure movie if it hadnt been based on a classic novel and directed by the authors grandson i kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel what resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardizationthe novel is a great scifi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it probably because they read it when theyre very young is that its overflowing with social commentary the eloi and morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of victorian england and the overall message of the film is that everything decays and degenerates a satiric jab at victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever theres no love story no romance with a beautiful eloi womanin the novel the eloi are 3foottall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal the time traveler does befriend an eloi woman but its clear he thinks of her more like a pet and anyway shes killed before the novel endsthis movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to why he wants to travel through time the treacly romance and the lessons he must learn are enough to make film fans vomitthe journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster ok not bad but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates as in the book more a reflection of the times i guess as the george pal version had a nuclear war take placethe general story ugh a total misrepresentation of the novel the eloi are too competent and warlike the morlocks are too intelligent the ubermorlock is an embarrassment and theres no setup he just shows up in time to be killed yawnsamantha mumba does ok guy pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain reportedly he broke a rib while filming this he also looks unhealthy and overly thin as if he had been ill for a long time before making thisa sad sorry film version of one of the worlds classics h g wells deserves bettermuch better,0,-1,positive,
when i started watching this i instantly noticed that i couldnt understand what anyone was saying i turned up the volume with background noises now booming out i could hear the voices just what are the actors saying is the movie not dubbed are they speaking spanish after some confusion i realize that it was english at least i think so the amazing jess franco has placed the microphones too far away from the actors as a result we cannot completely hear what they are saying hes done this before but maybe this is mr francos intention by not knowing what people are saying we are thrown into some mystery about what is going on and are left with more visual clues maybe its just me but i would have liked to know what was going on how about a few hints the basic premise i refuse to call it a plot concerns a young american exotic dancer named paula played by amber newman who has a boyfriend who gets her invited to a small island owned by some sleazy rich people it is somewhere off the coast of spain for this visit a large cash payment is promised to paula which the boyfriend gets he then escapes from the island only to return later why pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens paulas us passport though his hand tried to cover it up you can see the actress real name amber newman printed below the photo on the bottom of the passport anyway back to the story there are some other sleazy rich beautiful characters visiting the island all with ambiguous motives we witness sadistic games are they real or fake and unappealing dining scenes but the food must be good as a phony french chef prepared it there is a young woman servant who runs around naked and never speaks is she really mute and do we care of course all the women are mostly naked throughout this film oh well we can at least be thankful that the 50 and overweight men remain clothed in addition to the abysmal sound quality what i have always marveled at about jess franco is his amazing ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely turned off this film is no exception i needed fresh air after watching it in conclusion i am happy to report that regardless of what mr franco can dream up i am still attracted to women,0,1,positive,
what gives anthony minghella the right to ruin two extraordinary works of fiction first he destroyed the english patient which was bad enough but now i discover hes butchered cold mountain butcheredi had such a strange reaction to the english patient my son and i went to see it the first weekend it was released and i was so disappointed but told my son i felt like i needed to read the book i drove straight to barnes and noble bought it read it and tried to figure out what in the world the critics were talking about when they said minghella had trusted enough in the intelligence of the moviegoing public to give them a great film that is what he most surely did not do i do not ordinarily read a great deal of fiction but cold mountain was so highly recommended by friends that i felt compelled to read it i did not see cold mountain the movie when it played in theaters and it was because of what minghella had done to the english patient but like a fool i rented it today and im so upset i had to vent my frustration and most of all my sadness that someone could have taken this beautiful story and crafted it into something almost as beautiful on the screen and now they never will read the book and let the movie rot on the shelf i will never be taken in by a minghella project again i think he may be one of the worst directors working today and im tired of the praise hollywood heaps upon his head it must be that no one in hollywood reads anymore this movie bears no resemblance to the book except for the names of the characters minghellas ego must know no bounds and if he didnt like the book then why didnt he write an original screenplay and leave the book alone even if i hadnt read the book i would still consider this movie one of the worst ive seen from 2003 and ive seen almost everything thats been released for viewing in the usaelaine you arent going to like this one either,0,0,positive,
why do i like disorganized crime so much why do i chuckle or laugh out loud any time i think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie its kind of hard to explain but ill give it a try first of all its very funny indeed in contrast to what lots of official reviews want you to believe but then again that depends entirely on your sense of humour so there is no sense in arguing about that often the humour is in the dialogue and often it is situational comedy there is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck when the farmer drops them they just stand there by the road covered all over with cow s or whatever they are totally unnerved then realizing the humour of the scene they one by one start laughing about themselves and ruben blades as carlos looking and certainly smelling terrible nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again which leads to the second point the acting fred gwynne lou diamond phillips william russ ruben blades and corbin bernsen okay the latter overdoes it a bit at times all fit and play their parts beautifully in fact you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film thirdly there is the plot jim kouf the director and screenwriter is very laidback he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves more often than not there is no real action and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people who attempt to rob a bank although their boss bernsen does not seem to turn up grumble about each other and eventually grudgingly like each other the movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details incidentally the title of the film is one of the best i have ever come across because it perfectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way therefore take my advice watch this film but if you dont chuckle grin or smile during the first 10 minutes forget it its not your type of film ps the only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay if you happen to know how do tell me,1,-1,positive,

the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain or at least is an alan quartermain type of character that the 85 director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga with a touch of austin powersesquire cheese here and there it was labeled by many critics to have been a great parody or unintentional comedy unintentional is the word this movie was never intended to be humorous witty yes but not humorous unfortunately its witless rather than wittywith this new m4tv miniseries you get much more story character development of your lead solid portrayals and a fine even entertaining blend this story is a bit long much longer than its predecessors but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy while it features both action and eye candy it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq making for a fine well thought out plot and some nice complementing subplots now this attempt is not the all out actionextravaganza that is indiana jones nor is it a poor attempt to be so this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aqksm saga filmed on location in south africa the audience is granted beautiful if desolate vistas sa aboriginal cultures and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline heresteve boyum totally surprised me with this one as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision in fact i have disliked most of his work as a director until this attempt i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be this version rates a 9810 on the tv scale fromthe fiend,1,-1,positive,
it is true that some fans of peter sellers work may be disappointed with this his last venture but surely any fan of sellers will find delight in all of his films simply because of the mans huge talent and the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu is certainly no exception unfortunately this would prove to be sellers last film it was even released after his death but its still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his irreplaceable talent right until his untimely demise and not only do we get one sellers but we get to for sellers plays not only the title role but also his nemesis the equally bizarre nayland smith the detective on the hunt for the crazed 168 year old fu the story is equally outlandish as we follow fus outrageous antics to make his agedefying elixir and also nayland and his group of associates trying to prevent him just like any of sellers greater films the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him as well as many of his familiarfaced costars david tomlinson sid caesar john le mesurier clive dunn and helen mirren to name a few its also nice to see pink panther stalwart burt kwouk cato enjoying a cameo with sellers albeit playing the same role but still nice the story is indeed pretty ridiculous as are many of the characters involved which classes this as a film strongly under the goon influence and although it never reaches the heights of goon comedy there are plenty of amusing jokes that seem to point in the right direction the film failed commercially on its initial release due to the entire world mourning after sellers death the film was released less than 3 weeks afterand there is always that sorrowful thought lurking in the back of your mind when viewing it that this was sellers last film its far from a great film its often slow too ridiculous and sometimes the jokes simply arent there but it is nevertheless enjoyable if only for another top rate performance from peter sellers,0,1,positive,

reign over me is a success due to the powerful work by adam sandler and don cheadle while comedic actors going dramatic has been seen as somewhat of a distraction sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles most of the characters he portrays have an unstable temperament and a vulnerability that can burst at any moment he might even be typecast for characters with such hidden anger problems however this performance has some considerable dramatic weight unlike his roles in less comedic fare like punchdrunk love and spanglishin the film alan johnson cheadle runs into his old college roommate charlie finerman sandler whom he hasnt seen in several years five years before charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash charlie barely even recognizes cheadles character due to the repression of his memories and consequent reclusive childish lifestyle since the accident it isnt until alan persists in engaging him in conversation that charlie remembers who he is their renewed relationship that follows will allow finerman to have a friend who doesnt speak about his loss eventually enabling him to confront the thoughts and feelings he has suppressed on his own termsthough writerdirector mike binder doesnt show much sense of an individual style and some of his shots and transitions are a bit awkward he does have a knack of getting decent to great performances from his actors while being a talented and funny writer he shot this film with a digital camera as more and more filmmakers are doing today enabling the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting this kept the colorful backgrounds of new york city in focus but resulted in creating frequent digital grain which resembles blue specks scattered and moving on the screenalmost every main character in reign over me gives a great performance jadapinkett smith and especially liv tyler are memorable in their respective roles as a frustrated wife to cheadles character and a psychiatrist however it is sandler and cheadle that give some of their finest work to date they completely owned this movie sandler actually plays a character that doesnt outwardly resemble or act like himself at all partially credited to his bob dylanesquire wig though cheadles character has more screen time than sandler they both should be considered to be leading roles as they equally support and help each other throughout the filmmusic also plays a great part in this film especially the title song reign over me or love reign oer me by the who and later covered by pearl jam in one of the most powerful moments of the film binder shows sandler using music to shut out his feelings and memories but this particular song provokes such intense emotion that rather than diminishing his anger it incites his emotions all an all reign over me is an enjoyable sad yet many times funny film driven by its amazing leading performances,1,1,positive,
dont get me wrong i assumed this movie would be stupid i honestly did i gave it an incredibly low standard to meet the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going different story for a different time as i began watching i noticed something this film was terrible now there are two types of terrible theres freddy vs jason terrible where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is and then there is a movie like this the cat in the hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me as i watched the first bit of it not only was i bored senseless but i felt as though i had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie mike myers is usually brilliant i love the majority of his work but something in this movie didnt click one of the things that the directorproducerswriterswhatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book red black white on any character but the cat coincidentally or not they also refused to capture any of the original and i hate to use this word but it fits zaniness of the original the book was like an ice cream sunday colorful and delicious and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdustavoid this like a leprous prostitute,0,-1,positive,
this movie could have been an impressing epic but the makers seem to have done their utmost to make it appear foolish even god himself is not spared in this movie in that his words are drenched with childish jokes the result is blasphemous and annoying only people who dont care to see a cheap parody on the biblical story may perhaps watch this film without embarrassment the makers of this tasteless production should see il vangelo secondo matteo the gospel according to mathew a film of pier paolo pasolini who shows that it is unnecessary to pervert the words of the bible to make a good story the most impressing result is obtained by a sincere rendering of the plain text itself,0,-1,neutral,
ahh talespin what can i say that hasnt already been said about this great show nothing this is without a doubt one of the most wellwritten shows ive ever encountered liveaction or animation the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes and some of the mature stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for but not talespinthe stories are engaging and very plausible some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you where the emphasis is on hilarity i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice onesthe drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadaysat least those which arent specifically geared toward it especially in cartoons in the episode stormy weather for instance kit cloudkicker decides that hes going to join an air circus but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous in the biggest fight of the episode baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan to which kit screams no you cant tell me what to do yourre not my dad and buries his face in his pillow the next day he leaves for the air circus this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadaysthe characters have a lot of depth to them baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book plus or minus a few degrees of laziness rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money while good in theory are seldom good in practice molly is a cute little girl but you cant let that deceive you she can be a real hellion sometimes kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest he doesnt trust adults much unless they appeal to him and he has a tendency to break off relationships watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook he looks as though hes prepared to put it right through a piratein the end its the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show 1 in my book the relationship between baloo and kit is very real almost father and son this is demonstrated well in alls whale that ends whale when baloo takes kits word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults baloo and beckys relationship is also realistic due to baloos motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol sea duck not necessarily a desire to help rebecca but something tells me that if he did get the duck back hed still do jobs for rebeccathe sea duck not to mention all the other planes in the series is pretty realistically designed the planes functions dont change once throughout the seriescontinuity like that is hard to come by also and unlike most other superplanes of other cartoons it doesnt have one single weapon on boardunless you count mangoes and relies instead on its cunning pilots great skill to get out of trouble its hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesnt have some sort of gun turret laser cannon or even a handgun somewhere on board and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays plus its just such a darn cool designthis is definitely the best cartoon ever period definitely worth all ten stars,1,1,positive,
i have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of this kind of film you get very little appreciation for the caving surrounds or the monster that they face while the characters are clichd spiritual guy leader with tragedy in recent past etc and the ending was just weak it really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere i have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah i imagine that caves are dark showing near total blackness for half the film really brought that home i quite enjoyed the descent which for my money had better acting showed more tight caving situations better monsters and had a good endingspoilerthe monster turns out to be some guy whose plane crashed and parents were killed leaving him to grow up in the caves he seems to have developed super strength and speed but why is never addressed maybe the same force that drained their torch batteries caused this but during the film whenever someone is killed you get the impression of something large with claws that tears up each victim see how much blood splatters the walls but in the end its just some dude with a fur draped over him and a mask i would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were reached but this was hardly the case then he starts raping the last remaining caver and roll credits almost absurdly bad i thought sometimes a film is soo bad you can appreciate it and maybe have a laugh but this films fails to take itself lightly as well you watched it you cant unwatch it,0,0,positive,

this was disappointing it started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar it fell flat maria schraders acting is dreadful never seeming to mean what she says or even knowing what she says until she says it she showed no genuine emotion at all not for her beloved goy or her mothers story when with lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in lenas story there never seemed to be a real relationship between lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding which isnt much the supposed parallel between hannahs mixed romance and her mothers relationship with her father was as clich as they come and failed miserably anyway the wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish the climax of the protest was uninspiring and no matter what lena had or had not done to influence the outcome she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time a haunted look an inexplicable ambivalence in fact none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark it was very hard to care about any of them even little ruth everything with luis was a distraction why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel there was no context or explanation whatever for that if every reference to him was removed it wouldnt be noticed a simple story made confusing by poor character development who was whose mother again weak acting and directing that made everyone look like they were acting you could almost hear quiet on the set i started thinking this was worthy of a 7 but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4 then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene this was about as cold and sterile a movie as i have seen a terrible waste of a good story,0,0,positive,
this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things parts of hightech equipment presumably it isnt really made very clear the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how theyre herded around outside in little yellow jackets the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory and talking with his crew as he does so this is a world of relentless industrialization its a relief at least to know these soulless images arent going to be presented without a human voice as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalters gleefully cold documentary about the food industry our daily bread manufactured landscapes contains images of people scavenging ewaste and a town many towns really being wiped out by the biggest dam ever with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is some of these scenes the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places might have been shot memorably by the premier engag photographer sebastio salgado but this photographer isnt as interested in seeing people up close his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltzall this happens in china of course though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive there are a good many stills of the photographers workor were some of them made by the film crew it isnt made clearedward burtynsky is the name of the photographer we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring he admits himself that he takes no political stand when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the films cinematographer peter mettler burtynskys work almost amounts to a kind of glorification and hence falsification but he is showing us places that if we look closely reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may belogically but not entirely fortunately it is burtynsky whose voiceovers narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites burtynskys epiphanies may have inspired his decades of fine work but they amount to nothing but truisms about how were changing the planet irreparably are dependent on oil which will run out that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel the interest of manufactured landscapes would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it the reasons for watching it are two to see glimpses of burtynskys work and the raw materials the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully and to observe scenes from the vast awesome daunting and rather horrifying industrialization of modern chinabecause of the limitations of the narration the idea of the title manufactured landscapes feels insufficiently developed it even seems a misnomer new landscapes they are but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than manufactured landscapes of waste or wasted landscapes might be better titles there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions,1,-1,positive,
it is so nice to see bruce willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor he shines in this film as the near40yearold image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner childuntil he meets him face to face this is one of those rare films that doesnt talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the whole family it is about caring for each other keeping some of the child inside you and realizing that you dont grow up exactly the way you thought you would willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with kids just witness the sixth sense with haley joel osment and he has great chemistry with spencer breslin here there is some nice photography and music and the ending is wonderful and uplifting a great film to see with every member of your family,1,1,positive,
this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all generally speaking i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories and this one is great besides meryls performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise the movies greatest asset is the story it is based on the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eyeopening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions the other face of the socalled civilized society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings needless to say this is very general even though this specific tale unfolds in australia that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thoughtprovoking,1,-1,positive,

a nicely paced romantic war story that should have got more exposure the czech pilot who played piano gives a mellow touch to the story the flying footage may not have been enough for aviation buffs like myself but then again this really isnt an action movie though it does not have anything in common with the james salter novel the hunters that became the movie about korean war f86 sabre pilots dark blue world had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it better in some ways than battle of britain in that it doesnt rely on big name actors suggest viewing this movie with some czech beer and some czech dumplings called kneldnikysp,1,-1,neutral,

one of the best documentaries released in recent years some points1 hugo chavez was elected venezuelas president in 1998 his support largely coming from the poorer regions of venezuela2 in 2002 a coup briefly deposed chavez at the time irish filmmakers kim bartley and donnacha obriain were in caracas shooting a documentary about chavez for british television their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath and electrifyingly records history unfolding onthespot outside and inside the presidential palace3 chavez aimed to free venezuela from the freemarket policies imposed on it by the us though venezuelas oil was already stateowned it was run for private benefit by executives who chavez wished to replace4 despite being the worlds fourth largest oil supplier venezuela remains swamped by poverty its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations5 the documentary begins by portraying chavezs first years as president before the coup it focuses on his popularity with the poor and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals educational plans distribution of the oil revenue grassroot democracy etc6 chavez was a huge proponent of education and printed thousands of copies of the venezuelan constitution encouraging children and adults to study and understand it7 when chavez came to power he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits this understandably made the oil companies nervous8 a mediawar broke out the six private tv stations promptly began opposing the staterun tv station they questioned chavezs motives sanity and sexual orientation9 without media support the coup would not have been successful the film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated10 under the guise of reestablishing democracy the opposition silenced the staterun tv station dissolved the national electoral board supreme court national assembly and took control of the military11 moneyed interests backed by the military elite encouraged by the us and cia organised a citizens march on the presidential palace to effect the coup snipers shot at chvez supporters but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted12 police went on a shooting rampage against chavez supporters further bloodying the streets13 chavez held captive refused to resign of course the mediagovernment then lied saying he had resigned but chavezs cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community which eventually got the message back to venezuela by cable tv14 the people rose up pressuring the return of the president they had elected whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace8910 at a little over an hour long this doc is far too short nevertheless its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of media warfare which rarely gets touched upon makes a great companion piece to the battle of algiersworth one viewing,1,-1,positive,

naturally i didnt watch gi jane out of choice i was more or less forced to watch this film round my exgirlfriends housegi jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario which of course it isnt the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints restricting the amount of humour of which there is none or entertaining action scenes and soon becomes too serious the film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictablegi jane fails where other action films succeed mainly because films such as james bond dirty harry and various others are larger than life yet never proclaim to be otherwise they are escapism and therefore entertaining gi jane tries to be real and failsthis is a very disappointing film from ridley scott with a very noncredible storyline unremarkable acting and the only reason i give it 210 instead of 110 is for some of the technical work,0,0,negative,
i had been amazed by director antals kontroll back in 2003 his first american project vacancy was less impressive but a decent start armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable the film never rises above the level of a b movie its a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesnt really deliver in that department either what you are left with is one implausible situation after another a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money if you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score youre left with what could have been a below average directtovideo featuring van damme or seagal this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time,0,0,positive,

when the trailer for accepted first came up many people began to get excited about seeing it really excited who could blame them it looked like fun but thats exactly the thing people went into accepted looking for a good movie but if you think about it accepted isnt the type of film destined to be a good movie its meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given that being said for those of you who expected a great film you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one think that and you will truly enjoy the film because youll rid yourself of your idea that the movie will be fantastic bottom line watch the movie and have fun but dont look for anything groundbreaking,1,1,positive,
i am curious yellow a film in near seussical rhyme is said right at the start to be available in two versions yellow and blue was one of those big arthouse hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandalcausecelebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court whats potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of whats revealed in the sex or nudity the directoractor vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but its always moreso an intellectual expression than very lustlike but the daring of the attempt at a pure metafilm while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden who knew such things in a generally peaceful country ie usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars could be so heatedup politically at least thats part of sjomans aim here like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like wr if not as surreal and deranged or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex mostly politics and social strata around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film the two characters lena and borje have a hotcold relationship in the story of the film where lena is a curious socialistwannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and trains sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film theres even a great bit midway through where as if at a rock concert title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are negating having to use end credits then with this theres a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance not just a hey im the director playing the director bitat first one might not get this structure and that i am curious yellow is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class socialism spain and franco and once in a while we see lenas father or bjore but sjoman does something interesting the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes its impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative documentary filmwithinafilm and even a serious interview with martin luther king who also acts as a quasiguru for lena it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it doesnt feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewerif i am curious yellow stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a fullblown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it isnt entirely successful i think as an emotional experience where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even and borje ahlstedt a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the innerfilm of lena and borje since perhaps intentionally sjoman fills it up with clichs borje has a girlfriend and kid will he leave her how will lena reconcile her father and a heavyhanded narration from his starlet of sortsand yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious yellow holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what couldnt be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage id even go as far as to say its influential and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time a specific technique used with the film rewinding towards the end is echoed in poorer usage in funny games and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avantgarde or metafilmmaking if its not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as wr or last tango its close behind,1,1,positive,

easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays it has been seriously let down here shoddy direction stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedyin the town of verona the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo patrick rycart a montague falls in love with juliet rebecca saire a capulet bloodshed soon eruptsthe studio work especially in daytime scenes seriously stagnates the energy of the play its a story that with its energy deserves to be shot outdoors coupled with this the costumes are hideous with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces the stage fighting looks horrendous with far too much stretching and running around to be engagingpatrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo he manages the characters intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland often inexpressive eyes limit his range it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet she captures the characters naivet but a little more sassiness would have been welcomethe supporting roles dont fare much better joseph oconnors friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut anthony andrews mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result alan rickman underplaying his role has virtually no presence as tybalt he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years but that isnt in evidence here the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera only micheal hordern in probably his best role in this series comes out of this with any dignity his capulet is wellplayed and a joy to watchsee one of the other versions of this story instead,0,-1,positive,

so this is what actress kim basinger has succumbed to mmm to tell the truth the films title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic but simplicity can have its strengths anyhow by the end of while she was out i was left feeling rather indifferent not the worse despite being engulfed by negatives but theres easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm but compact and unbalanced latenight survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car parkthe problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material taken from a short story along with the very variable performances the flimsy script was poorly thoughtout which isnt so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events as for the bunch of stereotypical goons led by an unconvincing lukas hass as a loose canon terrorizing basinger well they were less than threatening but hopelessly clueless watching basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand dont ask me why knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didnt elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up basingers performance is stoutlike but doesnt craft much empathy craig sheffer shows up as her hotheaded husband strangely i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic why would she be constantly carrying it and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles aheadsusan montfords soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy as it pretty much chugs along i liked the opening credits though with its hauntingly sullen score which is the most effective thing throughout the feature and polished photographyno great shakes doesnt ask much of your time but i wouldnt care to see it again however with the inclusion of a joy division song it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen,0,0,positive,

wow where to begin with this one well if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers then this one is for you i bought this movie for 5 bucks because i never pass up an opportunity to laugh at bmovie god casper van diens blunders and boy was this one of them it may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever this thing which is supposed to be an indian ghost looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on halloween he dons a cape that is clearly a garbage bag complete with what appears to be a bucketshaped bonnet over his head at some points this is a man in costume at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse this monster has the uncanny ability to see with predator vision a clear ripoff and can miraculously appear after throwing his spear sometimes the spear cuts people sometimes it doesnt this thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow wow this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of critters this creature is impervious to bullets but somehow dies at the end of the movie at the end of his killing spree which we never really find out why he is on he gets blown up this is an incredible feat for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film but i guess this last time was the charm and dont even get me started on the lameness of the other characters first of all what delta force unit employs women last i checked the military still disallows women into combat situations also this unit is undercover why what possible reason would they have to be undercover and theyre not even good at it i guess no one would realize that they were military if they didnt have on uniforms but they were all carrying machine guns which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film at some points sounding like air rifle bb guns and at others canons there is one part when the skeleton man throws some construction workers from a catwalk and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto at another point michael rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground they tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of an incline but he is clearly pushing himself along in this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene then when he is helped back up the hill the rope is flat and when it shows the woman at the top of the hill the rope goes upward from her grip not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill rooker actually has a line that says im not going after him i going after it what that is quite possibly the dumbest thing i have ever heard and i watch these bad movies as a hobby the saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writingproduction of this film thought that it was so badass believe it or not compared to the rest of the dialog this is good the acting bad the makeup really bad these characters either had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face maybe these are alien scars that like to run around on your face yeah i think ill make a movie about that attack of the alien scars that move around on your face that villain would be more intimidating than the skeleton man and the film would probably be scarier,0,0,positive,
i have just seen caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual vistas film festival held here in dallas and i must express my discontent the opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of south american countries costa rica in this particular case by north american oil companies and the negative effects both economic and environmental of this invasion the main characters are a married couple who live a simple pleasant life maintaining a banana farm right away a woman arrives and announces that she is the wifes halfsister im not going to go into specifics about this and to be honest i dont feel that im spoiling anything with this review yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy so the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place trying to preserve his livelihood on one hand the reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation basically a bribe to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town compromising his standing with the community and the community itself on the other hand he is faced with being dead broke but on the side of his community protesting the drilling given the length of this film it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described but it just doesnt happen and ill tell you why you will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far one for direction and an audience award im not going to pick apart estebans direction it wasnt bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything the audience award was at a film festival in spain and for it to gain an audience award id have to imagine that spanish people just dig soap operas in fact central and south america dig soap operas as well i know that much i assume that esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas because that is what unfolds over the course of this film so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes the only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is its almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely from time to time they toy with the oil against community plot but these are digressions at best what we see a lot more of are scenes of passion jealousy betrayal adultery etc these themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company subplot becomes unnecessary its almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama soap opera by throwing in a little political relevance nevertheless the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesnt know what to do with itself resulting in an ending so tacked on that youre left wondering what it is that youve been waiting around for or if there was ever anything to begin with here are two things that i think could have saved this movie either cut out the halfsister or cut out the oil company its obvious which one of the two they were more interested in or perhaps if caribe had been an hour longer they could have worked this all out regardless id have been fine with a straightup soap opera and i think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community caribe is both and neither these two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot thats barely been established to begin with both sides suffer best of all the romance plot is never even resolved id like to say id watch this movie again to see what ive missed but i have a strong feeling that i already know what it is as far as im concerned it wouldnt matter if i saw caribe ten more times ive missed it because it is simply not there,0,0,positive,
movies are something you see on saturday night and forget by sunday morning motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever mishima falls into the latter category this is the type of thing that should win academy awards a brilliant visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of yukio mishima director paul schrader interweaves three adaptations of the authors stories into a look at his past and final day on earth the day he tried to lead the japanese military into rebellion in the name of the emperor failing to do that he commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of bricks the three short story adaptations allow a look into what led him to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be filmed stage plays ken ogata is magnificent as mishima despite his eccentricities he comes off as very sympathetic a man who is quite willing to die for his beliefs and does this makes the ending that much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful of the three story adaptations temple of the golden pavilion kyokos house and runaway horses it is the last that is the strongest and most emotional it also is the story that most closely matches mishimas mood in his final years and illustrates what truly led him to the events of november 1970 this review cannot be complete without a mention of philip glass striking musical score not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to its visuals paul schrader crafted one of the most beautiful movies of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter have the hankies at the ready because the ending will leave you in tears mishima a life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant,1,1,positive,
i enjoyed this film it was funny cute silly and entertaining had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that i truly dont understand no it wasnt the grapes of wrath or casablanca or even moonstruck but it was an enjoyable filmjulia was excellent playing the psychotic man behind the man the story is a little silly to be sure but it this isnt high drama folks i happened to see a review of the film probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it and im glad i saw it eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile and i watch it a couple times a year,1,1,positive,
this movie has the made for tv stink all over it though it started out with great intentions featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes the film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another the germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are please take my word for this i am a huge fan of the war genre and this movie is crap nevertheless this dvd does have an excellent extra feature covering letters from the wwi front lines thus making this rental not a total waste of my time,0,1,positive,
running out of time is probably as close to a perfect film as youre ever likely to see out of hong kong all the elements click a terrific script by french writers julien carbon and laurent courtiaud that even manages to subvert the odd clich reliably imaginative direction by johnnie to and excellent central performances by andy lau and lau ching wan the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody especially in his exasperated reactions to his superiors abysmal negotiating skills the supporting cast is fine too with yo yo mung making a strong impression in a tiny role and even the often histrionic waise lee looking remarkably and very aptly like a bald andy lau reining it in to good effect its best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic setup with only a few weeks to live lau engages in a criminal game with wans cop with no easily apparent motive and just sit back and enjoy the ride its certainly worth the fare it also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies and played in a mere three scenes the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of filmmaking ive seen in ages theres also a fine score by raymond wong as well the most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years,1,1,positive,
this film was a big disappointmenti take the opposite view of the critics this is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors here the actors bette davis and james cagney are simply not up to the level of the material clark gable and claudette colbert were every bit as big as davis and cagney and look how it happened one night turned out an alltime classic with a very similar story davis proves that she has no talent for comedy good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted davis onenote performance oozes petulance but none of the nuances of colberts acting in it happened one night cagney who was a great comedy actor just seems outofsync with his costar davis the script provides some decent lines and gags but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedypart of the problem is the soundtrack which like the delivery of davis and cagney seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedyjack carson who played similar roles throughout his career has more capably handled very similar material in a fairly typical supporting role eugene palette delivers a respectable performance in a slightly different role as an old west relic harry davenport is very good but in one of his poorest performances william frawley is quite irritating his characters constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony i really love every one of these performers and it is a shame that as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than the bride came cod,0,-1,positive,

i loved the first season the quality went down a little bit in the second season which however had a great middle pegasus third season was fairly novel and original and was ok fourth season started going downhill fast because they never even began giving us any explanations when by now we were really starting to need them what the hell was the cylon plan why were there two cylon factions what was the point of angelkara leading the fleet to a devastated earth1 what kind of a past did the last five cylons have and how did they survive or were they reincarnations questions everywhere answers nowhereand then comes the end earth2 our earth in the past well okay but destroying the fleet giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life and spreading a few thousand people paperthinly across the planet thats not only antiscience its antireason and antilife and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive ai that ruins everything it is without vision without hope for a grander future for humanity and it is antithetical to proper science fiction and dont even get me started on the angels religious claptrap of the worst kind the ultimate disappointmentthe whole all this has happened before and will happen again thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series not just to earth as we know it making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius frakkin shame1 out of 10,0,-1,positive,
i must confess i was surprised at how good this movie was when i first watched it i had planned to see it in theaters during the summer but found out unpleasantly that it had already been and gone therefore i expected it to have been removed from theaters because it was bad then today i rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it the speed that events were occurring was questionable it could have been a little longer i found it was very true to the book however it left out some crucial parts mullet fingers real name etc i felt as if i hadnt read the book i wouldnt have really understand what was going on the acting was quite good another thing i had expected to be poor however the cop sorry i cant remember the actors name could have done a little better all in all i found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all audiences,1,0,positive,

working from a script written in part by nicholas pileggi best known for writing the book wiseguy which he adapted into the movie goodfellas and for writing the book and screenplay casino director harold becker shows how connected circles scratch each others backs even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like pappas who is regarded as a presidential prospect as cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobsters probation report his skepticism is agitated how did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence we meet the other players in the plot not the least of which is danny aiello the political boss of brooklyn and tony franciosa the mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead how and why these people are affiliated i leave to the movie to divulge though there are never any misgivings that they arethe narrative is told generally through the eyes of the cusack character a visionary from louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite but considering i just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge one cant say it doesnt work the shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayors desk a charge by aiello for a subway stop and an offramp in brooklyn to aid a new banking center and the citys bid for the next democratic convention individual idiosyncrasies are also explored including aiellos emotional bond with the music of rogers and hammersteinmuch also is made of menschkeit a yiddish expression which pappas explains to his deputy is about the bond of honor between two men about what happens between the two hands in a handshake this connection doesnt mean much to bridget fonda the lawyer for the policemans association who defends the dead cops honor and fights for his widows pension even as incriminating evidence appears little by little the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he lawthere are various scenes of hard impact including one where the brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked and then the mafia boss drops in by surprise there is also a compelling and markedly conjectural late scene between the mayor and his deputyone scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayors decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child in a harlem church his advisers tell him he wont be wanted there but he goes anyway and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole pacino and his character bothit gets an impressive reaction from the congregation but the mayor knows and his deputy knows that it was artificial and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it in the limousine taking them away is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo this is a script that knows it has to supply pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speechpacino and cusack are convincing together throughout the movie the older man unbreakable and aware the younger one anxious to learn but with ideals that dont sway pacino is innate with his downtoearth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination inspired flair and matteroffact realism cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensivenessthe bridget fonda subplot development is unnecessary but it is a result of veteran screenwriter paul schraders otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments aiello for instance is a highlight because he evokes his characters joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment,1,-1,positive,

this particular episode of smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion this is for many reasons for example it takes the series back to some of its roots it welcomes back lionel from a supposedly long absence with the luthorcorp plaza office in metropolis this room hasnt been in smallville for a very long time and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallvilles past not to mention lionels conversations with lex are always admirableanother pleasant return is well uv guessed it is bart allenaka impulse acaka aquaman and victor stoneaka cyborg not only does steven deknight reunite the former justice leaguers he blends them in with the smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost feels like it is a feature length moviefrom there you get the basic story green arrow forms the league attempts to blow up 331 bart gets captured clark saves him and the facility is blown to kingdom com all is good and graceful with a good mix of stealth action pace and suspense oh and cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character the music is probably what makes this episode work so well if you remember correctly the first episode steven deknight directed was agless from season 4 this was a mediocre episode but something felt out of place maybe it was the music or the acting or the fact clark sais at the end we didnt find you you found us kind of made people lose faith in the formula but thankfully steve deknight redeemed himself in this justice episodei had a few quivvles about justice that made it fall short of the full 10 first of all the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the ridge facility expolsion i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on olivers bike rememeber from the arrow episode clark and impulse should have obviously ran and aquaman should have swam via another route but that was soo incredibly cheesy it nocked off 2 points from the full 10secondly another cheesy moment not as bad as the first but when green arrow sais lets go save the world that made me cringe all in all judging by the acting performances music direction and production values the pros do outweigh the cons and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history and maybe the 2nd best episode in season 67 out of 10,1,0,positive,
okay so the plot is on shaky ground yeah all right so there are some randomly inserted song andor dance sequences for example adams concert and henris stage act and leslie caron cant really um you know actbut somehow an american in paris manages to come through it all as a polished firstrate musicallargely on the basis of gene kellys incredible dancing talent and choreography and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with caron he needs to because she seems to have a problem with emoting the most accomplished and technically aweinspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16minute ballet towards the end of the film its stunningly filmed and kelly and caron dance beautifully but my favourite number would have to be kellys character singing i got rhythm with a bunch of french schoolchildren then breaking into an array of american dances it just goes to prove how you dont need special effects when youve got some real talentnot on the classics level with singin in the rain but pretty high up there nonetheless worth the watch,1,-1,neutral,
this film really misses the mark on most fronts the accents are laughably weak the acting amateurish and the comedy weak at besttheyve got a great idea it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned abovethe writer seems to think by putting the word fck into every sentence itll make it funnier and the main character just seems to try a little too hard hes no brick top thats for surenext time at least get a cast that can keep the accent for the whole filmits a crime to compare this to films like the business lock stock and snatch,0,1,positive,

warning this may contain spoilersfirst of all i watch a lot lifetime movies and realize they are just thatlifetime movies some are great really some are good and some are bad unfortunately this movie falls into the latter category it actually started out with some potentialsingle divorced hard working mom who gets out of work at 200 am cuts a guy off while driving home from work and lets just say he doesnt take it too well the stalking begins immediately with phone call hang ups and escalates to her home being broken into and completely trashed so she goes to her mothers for the night and the next morning her mothers car blows up this seems to be just a pain in the butt for our heroine who deals with it by going underwear and jewelry shopping so the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe keeping and what does mom do she goes off to work leaving the kid all alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a pizza i couldnt believe it then it really gets stupid and the ending just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical too bad because it seemed to have possibilities,0,-1,positive,
i dont know if i hate this movie as much as i did when i watched it two weeks ago but if youre expecting the events described on the box forget it that would have been a good movie the great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into utter dispair that i took viewing this movie if youve seen hbos taxi cab confessions this is the same thing only fictional and not even remotely as interesting if you really want to see something interesting about a cab driver check out the 20 minute short they run on encore from time to time it is actually worth watching i have never ever asked for my money back for a movie until i saw this thing boring boring boring it does offer one unique trait which is this it leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers letting your imagination fill in the gaps which would be great if you actually cared about any of these people instead i found myself yelling at the screen weeping like a child praying for either the end of the movie or my own death the cab driver himself though well played considering runs through emotions seemingly at random from sarcastic to sympathetic to raging lunatic to apathetic sometimes it is appropriate most of the time its just a display for its own sake dammit i learned all these emotions in acting class and im gonna use them now that ive been thinking about it again i do hate this movie as much as i did,0,-1,positive,
the box at my video store is why i rented this one it looked cool from the guys face axed in half so of course i had to give it a try i was pleasantly surprised when i actually watched it being an evil dead fan the swedish makers must of been fans as well as they included lots of references in this masterpiece a criminal tries to break into the house evil ed was editing the movies that ultimately drive him insane in and says groovy as he looks at his weapon quite like bruce campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in evil dead 2 there is also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and office in the movie they dont just spoof evil dead as there is a gremlin style puppet monster that cusses at ed in his refrigerator my personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says im coming to get you barbra which in case you didnt know is barbras brothers main line in night of the living dead this movie pretty much has it all good plot cool characters funny stuff gremlin puppetscary stuff demon doctor excellent effects exploding head and a fair amount of female nudity i only gave it a 9 because its kind of slow before ed goes insane but its well worth the wait so if you liked evil dead 2 or any of the other movies i mentioned above you gotta rent and watch it with a freind and when your done try brain dead because i hear it is similiar to this masterpiece,1,1,positive,
this was indeed an amazing adaption i missed the first episode so i unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline but as soon i watched the second and then the third instalment i was just blown away i ordered the dvd less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come i went straight out and brought the book from the moment i opened it i was hooked i just couldnt put it down i decided to finish the whole book before i dare watch the dvd at all i preferred the book because it got inside the characters minds you could understand totally where they were coming from and what there role was within the story they missed a lot out of the adaption which was disappointing as the book is a master piece and i think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it over a longer period of time but considering only being able to be fitted into a 3 hour slot i think it was done excellent it followed the main twisted storyline brilliantly and the actors which were enrolled as the main characters where amazing the love making scene was pure beautiful it was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be i was totally blown away with both the book and the tv adaption i loved both of sarah waters previous novels and also found the tipping the velvet adaption quite enjoyable but when i read and watched fingersmith i knew none of her previous novelsadaption could beat it sarah waters has indeed exceeded herself this time i recommend that you watch this adaption if tipping the velvet wasnt your thing then dont let it put you off this one fingersmith is a whole new ball game it is a beautiful yet dark twisted story about love greed and betrayala must see,1,1,positive,

this was painful recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper this britishbelgian coproduction from 1977 couldve fooled me it looks ten years older than that at least is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the halfhour mark consider yourself a trouper the combining of animation and live action is ropey at best and downright dreadful at worst which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasnt really there harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless ive seen with the obligatory trippy moments especially where the animation of the brainiactype subtracto character is involved that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties onward instantly dated the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored as for adults stick to jonathan swifts original novel,0,0,positive,
anyone who watched alien vs predator mustve known that the conventions of the alien quadrilogy were not exactly adapted for the film amongst some of the unusual elements the rapid growth of the aliens over seemingly a matter of minutes aliens with extremely long tails and so on however the idea of the predator species providing the impetus of city and temple building to create a hunt for would be warriors sounded so appealing that i couldnt resisti had hoped the end of the film would not be the impetus of this sequel and unfortunately i was wrong for those who forgot how the first film ended the dead predator had an alien burst through his chest which carried the traits of both speciesfor this film im going to just go through a list of good and bad traitsthe good lots of gorgeous people especially the men the bad lots of gorgeous people get munched by both the mutant predatoralien and the predatorthe good an interesting idea of the predator planet the bad an inconsistent scale of a town its a small town without many opportunities but with a very sophisticated read big city sewer system and homeless is it a small town or a city the police force is one sheriff and three deputies or so i countedthe good um the bad why do these mutant alienspredators grow so fast in a matter of five minutes they seem to grow to their full size i mean cmonwhat are these thingschia pet aliens and while were on this subject why is it that an alien inside a predators body mutates but an alien in a humans body doesnt does that make sensethe good still thinking the bad why would only one predator come and why does it pour acid over all the remnants of the aliens but it decides to murder a cute deputy and then skin him and hang him upside down i mean so much for being incognitothe good ahim stuck i guess theres lots of loud sounds the bad how do these mutated alienpredators procreate apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss type of motion they deposit several offspring into the womans body yeah just what youd like to see eh pregnant women having their bodies explode into mutant aliens as if the previous way wasnt gross enough i mean there isnt even an alien queenthe good did i say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous the bad when a nuclear device blows apart buildings how does a helicopter manage to survive the blast and how tacky is it for one of the passengers to mockingly chide the pilot i told you not to crash i mean given the nuclear fallout when he wakes up in the morning hell have no hair lefti could go on and on but i think you get the message mutated alienpredator bursts through dead predators body grows over the matter of a couple of minutes kills all the predators and manages to get crashed on earth more mutant alienpredators are created while one measly predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species predator kills humans mutant alienpredators kill humans humans kill humans sucks to be a human in this movie ehif youre impressed by lots of bangs and bumps youll love this movieif you liked the first i suggest you skip this sequel,0,0,positive,

perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of jane austens works has been portrayed perhaps i am too severe on this adaptation but im afraid i am biased to the ae version i have a hard time imagining mr darcy portrayed by anyone other than colin firththe characters seemed shallow and often dialogue forced lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book her fancy for wickham was overplayed and then her sudden like for darcy was not believabledarcy was portrayed tolerably well i will grant him he managed to maintain the aloofness that is required but i felt he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that makes his character so delightful especially in the proposal scenemr and mrs bennet were also played well but seemed lacking in many ways the mean temper of mrs bennet was not completely captured in her performancemr collins was a good portrayal very much in line with the booki will refrain from commenting on lady catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst portrayal in the entire filmother problems i saw were the few liberties they took with the order of events such as darcy being present at the first meeting with lady c and also that miss lucas and sir william did not join lizzy on her visit to the collinsthe choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes the scene where lizzy and darcy dance loses much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look akward on the ballroom floor at least this bbc version left out the dialogue between lizzy darcy and sir william when he commends the two on their dancing as they performed very ill indeedthere were occasional moments that it kept me interested but overall i find this version to be a disappointment i would not advise this film unless youre like me and you are excessively diverted by such follies,0,0,negative,

i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow yet thoughtful actions of the storytelling i am still a fanwith some minor painsthough this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series hada stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everythingsound familiar i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellowdramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to bellyache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plansespecially the character called wufeii mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera get a counselorwill yabesides for the overexaggerated dramai think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again i mean it can always be worse it could be like the recent installment seedeeeewwww talk about mellowdramaticill chat about that one later,1,-1,positive,

honestly when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off as i sat there for the next 10 minutes or so i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasnt been in more comedies he has this marty feldman thing going for him but much much more talenttaking nothing away from marty the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk but then again it was so much more i really think that if this movie was released first and i saw the steve martin movie 2nd id think the 2nd was a cheap ripoff i know it sounds like a bold statement but its true i actually like steve martin a great deal but his performance is 2nd to the actor in the jerk too i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection i urge you to see it if you can find it,1,1,positive,
wanda nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls script pacing and direction are uniformly awful action sequences defy belief characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set but also includes multiple sexual references involving shields character as well as graphic deaths the movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid and a childrens movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities it also wants to be a buddy picture a coming of age picture a ghost movie an indian spiritual movie a travelogue and a western the overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist wanda nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the grand canyon that it manages to do just fine,0,0,negative,
i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes if you dont have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nightsnow to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you dont mind here goes alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at cafs and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alexs affection and had a mnage trois to boot finally at the end its revealed veronika is pregnant with alexs child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilbertes situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to franoise lebruns character of veronika she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and laud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed not a bad effort 710,1,0,positive,
this film has the guts to suggest that it might be best to simply accept your life as it is and keep smiling anyway as one who is more excited by the idea of taking charge of ones life and moving forward i felt slapped in the face but thats okay i dont have to agree with a movie to love it and respect it great acting by streep and hurt and everyone else really and some wonderfully quirky scenes a serious film and take a hanky,1,1,positive,

really when it comes down to it this movie is just not funny josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny and yet he thinks hes hilarious the plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first until joshs look at me im wacky approach began infesting each and every scene the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to and that is saying quite a bit since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies debaser i have just one thing to say what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to writedirectproducestar in such a terrible movie,0,0,negative,
this is a disappointing adaptation of the james lee burke novel in the electric mist of the confederate dead it is rather poorly acted mainly due to the miscasting of the principal players tommy lee jones a normally fine actor just doesnt capture burkes dave robicheaux as robicheauxs main nemesis john goodman does a sloppy job as the heavy the guy who plays robicheauxs actorbuddy doesnt look like a former a lister leading man the rest of the movie is mainly cast with noname locals who just dont do justice to a bigtime novelthe movie and jones performance is way too hurried for one thing robicheaux in burkes series of novels gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time being laid back and slowmoving this is just like the deep south and southern louisiana then at times robicheaux is nearly manic in his exertions jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie he doesnt vary ned beatty is wasted mary steenburgen is out of place about the only good thing about this is the setting on the whole the movie gives one the impression of a tv movie,0,0,negative,

the main achievement of this film is that though racially unipolar the film still manages to carve out a tableaux of war portrayals that leave a lasting identification with whoever may view it and whoever was present at this time though good films may have the ability of universalizing their subjects which is often a hard thing to do great films have the ability of universalizing their unipolar subjects which is what this film doesinstead of carving a context of unity the film depicts the japanese in the sick finality of the phillipines warfront in february 1945 making signs for pacifism or war but rather making signs of the feelings death destruction victory and sickness of war with the bloody hands of the defeatedfar different and superior to films such as apocalypse now and full metal jacket both which needed a satirical methodology of trivializing and depersonalizing the american troupes and using all races as one struggle which is fine yet not as grand as a film that uses one race and view which would look fascist if created in america to convey the horror of war and show what it is really likethe only way the main character makes it through this movie to the end is by being sick thence inedible hence through this character through his sickness his saving face we see the end of wwii in the phillipines in february of 1945 and the way in which the americans japanese and phillipinians came together in bloody acts of warfare where you live to diethe film is patently influenced by a neorealist way of filmic portrayal which is original and beneficial to a viewer whether then or now for the neorealist techniques it employs conveys all the horrors of war in pictorial form whether a showcase for pacifism or militaristic responsibility like germania anno zero by roberto rossellini a story emerges from the environment and the conditions associated with itthe films opening with the twoway discussion between the two japanese soldiers prefigures and reechoes the events through this opening we feel that the struggle is human against human and human with human it shows that they relied on each other to face the enemy in the past battles but now in this opening or pivot of the experiences of the japanese in the phillipines new information is relayed to the main character tamura giving a presentiment of a cannibal reliance on one another if they wish to survivethe jungle is gritty wet and thick and the sky is not infrequently cloudy and pouring we wade with the stragglers though puddles and marshes as sick as the land around them nameless cadavers are strewn everywhere every now and then one can not tell if they are bodies rocks or corn apparently there is no difference here all is dead and sick all is dying all they have lest to feed upon are rare monkeys and dead bodies of fallen comrades andor nameless enemiesoften tamura meets a fallen other near death though crushed in spirit and crushing his some offer up their bodies for him to eat but he refuses he still like hiroshi kawaguchi as nishi in giants and toys will not droop into the death of dignity and japanese morals for this is all he really has to hold up for his survival a dignity of self hence when nagamatsu is dissecting a soldier for consumption he shoots him because of it tamura may be used to the killing but to the sickness of killing and pillaging he cant decipher he is neither a good man or a bad man he wishes to survive but will not go the extra mile beyond simple straightwarkilling his self belonged dead on the battlefield he isnt happy here to wade and wipe the weak for his survivalthe sickness he carrys he sees everywhere in everyone and sadly he lacks the ethical rationale of thinking either thinking entirely about others since he cant give up his body for them since of his contagious malady or thinking entirely about himself since he sees the sickness in everyone though still killing them even if they do no harm seen in his attack on the two philippianss in the hut he cant see anyone no one can see anyone the only see an aversion from malady and an adversion to health the heart of survival instinctsoften an arm appears pointing to the left of the screen towards what must be hope for there in that far thule lies their freedom yet it is blocked by american soldiers leaving the japanese stragglers to slowly die in this disconsolate dirt even a church tower appears reflecting the light off an unseen sun but on closer inspection crows flutter wildly about it religion too is an air of poisonnobi the japanese title of the film gives more evidence to the themes or feelings of the film the servitude to fate the heaviness of existence under leaders and lives controlled by others its proper anglophone translation has a subject of heavy debate among historians as nonkoreans translate it as slave and slavery while many koreans argue that nobi was not a slave system but a servant class system that does not meet the criteria for slavery a way to typically to escape wrenching poverty this improves upon the war theme and symbolism of soldieryisnt it important at the time period to ask ourselves what the purpose is of what will

hooray for title misspellings after reading reviews and contemplating my girlfriend and i confirmed that this movie is an utter piece of trash this movie lost her as one of those rare tarantino fansi wish it were made on nitrate film and all the copies piled neatly underneath a chainsmoking tarantino fanboy the literally needless violence the plot holes tarantinos tableitis sans drama and absent character development made this a thoroughly painful glorified montage what acting was there and how much of that was just because i was too busy reading the subtitles i watch my share of fansubbed anime and kudos for the attempt at authenticity but it was overdone for an englishlanguage movie with the glaring historical inadequacies the constant reading killed what acting there waswhy pay money for a narrator who will have absolutely no tie to any of the characters plot themes setting or anything involved in the movie when the movie needs that sort of off hand explanation its foreshadowing the utter filth that followshistorical research while it was sprinkled with interesting factiods used the proper costumes and props for the soldiers this movie stretched the truth beyond belief even for historical fiction kudos on mata hari reference though using it as foreshadowing was a bit much mata hari was executed by a firing squad not choked in an isolated room this ruined any sense that the reference may have hadother reviews mention more than half a dozen homages to other artists in the first 15 minutes considering the audience all these and other references were completely lost on many who would bother to see this movie and all who would enjoy itim confused by his choices of when to start a scene end it and what needs to be included in a movie promoted as an action film why did it take nearly 20 minutes to set up any sort of testosterone what i believe to be the message was trite the idea of rats and how we act on a primal nature against them and who is the rat were at best clichd but at worst not realized mention of american camps for the japanese and german americans would have added legitimacy to this question to the moral high ground literally every character in the film that gets a speaking role was caught up in their own legend is that the world in which tarantino livesim glad i didnt pay to see this one i regret that i bothered to view it at all even with wellmeaning hosts there was a rich base of ideas to develop but none were realized,0,0,positive,

it wasnt until i looked at the trivia section that i found out that the original producerstar of this movie tyrone power died during its making this no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic you know when youve been painting a wall until youre completely bored well thats the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when theyre swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner the plot centres on soloman the king of israel having an affair with the queen of sheeba and his people not being happy about it you cant really blame them since theres few things more beautiful in the world than those israeli moteks though the israeli women here all seem to look like cherie blair modern day israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in european and american accents after much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed and no thats not praise we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered israelis have to defend themselves against a massed egyptian army who cant read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them this is what i dont get even though their blinded by the sun the egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the israelis never ever realising theyre charging towards a gaping ravine isnt this somewhat illogical its also something of a revealing error since the horses chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures anyway the film ends with soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising god for his victory but who needs moshe dayan arik sharon or god when youve got an idiotic enemy who cant see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall,0,-1,neutral,

chuck joness rabbit seasoning the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy is often considered to be the best of the three while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons i would have to concede that rabbit seasoning is the most finely honed script here the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and costellos whos on next routine as a long term daffy fan i have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines the famous pronoun trouble being one of the all time classics and does most of the work bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer as always is the befuddled dupe part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst being shot in the face again and again his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration youre despicable as intricate an example of chuck joness impeccable timing as youll come across rabbit seasoning is a true classic,1,0,positive,

the devils plaything is my second attempt at a joseph sarno production and although i will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic swedish wildcats it is still a little slow and unexplicit for my tastethis one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle that want to resurrect their previously murdered leader in order to do so the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff and of course drink some blood too when a doctor and her brothers car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampiresbut they may not be as helpless as they seemthe devils plaything is a pretty good example of early 70s exploit sleaze lots of nudity including some fullfrontal some sleazy undertones including incest and of course lesbobloodsuckingbut these scenes are still pretty tame by todays standards some pretty hot women in this one would have benefited from some more explicit sex but i guess ya cant have it all also would have benefited from some heavier violencegore being that it is a vampire film but i think the purpose of the devils plaything was more to showcase skin not blood still a little slow and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden but thats to be expected from something from this era and of this budget worth a look to exploit fans others may find it a little too dull for their liking 710,1,-1,neutral,
lets get one thing straight this was bad so putrid that it doesnt even qualify to be imprinted on anyones memoriesthe ever repeating storyline whos constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances a typical storyline goes as follows sue the mother opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful as if that doesnt get old hardebloodyhar some australian quasinationalist bogan look it up appears to say how she thinks shes awesome because shes an ozzie while everythingeveryone else that isnt sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode a small mercythe rest of the plot revolves around the father gary getting in some kind of disagreement with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it outthe phrase words fail me is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say it is so incredibly bad so horrible that i would like every trace of its existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go onit saddens me though to see someone as good as sally bretton good actress i like her make a prat out of herself ardal o hanlon my hero aside has the ability to be pretty funny but not here and ben elton distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with thisthing then comedy is in very serious trouble,0,0,positive,

boogie nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997 i could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it im in no rush to watch that overblown romancedisaster epic titanic again the fact that boogie nights did not even receive a best picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrowminded the academy is only atom egoyans the sweet hereafter and robert zemeckiss contact came close to being as great as boogie nights no other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as tarantinos pulp fiction until now paul thomas anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded just as tarantino gave john travoltas career a kick pt anderson has given burt reynolds the kick that his career needs boogie nights will also undoubtedly make stars of don cheadle heather graham and john reilly overall a wonderful film the best since pulp fiction maybe even better,1,1,positive,

ive read that paolo sorrintinos inspiration for the consequences of love came from simply observing a businessman alone in a brazilian hotel and speculating what he might be doing there the film unfolds to us in a similar way we view the existence of titta who has lived alone in a hotel in switzerland for 8 years he is secretive and avoids friendship his life is dominated by order and regularly gradually the truth of his existence is revealed to us until finally his world begins to fall apartthe mystery of titta is central to the consequences of love and it works thanks in large part to the superb performance by toni servillo his character becomes all the more intriguing to us as little details are revealed that he injects heroin once a week that he has no imagination although some here criticise the dialogue for not being naturalistic that doesnt matter in my view this is not that sort of film and i think the script is great the camera work is also excellentif you have to criticise the film does lose its way a in the later scenes as the mystery of tittas existence is revealed to us and as his world begins to fall apart however the tragic final scenes are every bit as good as the earlier buildup,1,1,positive,

this is my favourite kung fu movie it has a very authentic flavour seasoned by an eerie music score of tradition chinese instruments i think and some wonderfully overacted melodramatic moments contrasted by heavily affected comedy indeed while attempting to create their own western ie cowboy film genre the chinese concocted a whole new animal marked by kung fu fighting and its associated sound effectsthe story of five fingers of death is simple a story of revenge for killing a loved one and the pursuit of the main character to master the ironfisttechnique that will enable him to wreak holy vengeance on his enemies there is even a love interest though the awkward polite kind found in most chinese films of the period the end result however is great and much more authentic than any bruce lee movie,1,1,positive,

for a good half hour or so i remember myself thinking hey this could very well be bill rebanes best achievement ever the opening sequences are atmospheric there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker the giant spider invasion in a playful way the concept is shamelessly stolen from william castles house on haunted hill with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win 1000000 in an elimination game naturally the participants start vanishing quickly and one by one and it takes the remaining greedy boneheads too much time before they realize either the old folks are sadistsor theres another murderer amongst them the film begins ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that isnt relevant or even interesting to the plot but theres some nice ta to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo shelly i believe shes called is really hilarious to observe after the first half hour naturally the inevitable happens and the cold turns into a textbook rebaneproduction with retarded plot twists the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement there wasnt any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multitalented director tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band the film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a slight bit satisfying maybe it was an inspiration for lotr return of the king avoid this film youll live longer and happier,0,-1,positive,
i remember this film as the other person that commented said i recorded over it but wish i had it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever funny in a real bad way i remember the tag line on the box was the ultimate frontal lobotomy i got it from my mom who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst cheesiest movie she had ever seen so my mom said my son will probably love it and the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession i then later taped over it which i regret i also remember the corck screw thing was one of those ball catcher things the yellow cone shaped things with a red button at the end and when you hit the red thing it sends a ball flying well they used that with a crank on one end and a corkscrew in the funnel when the killer killed they would show him coming forward with the weapon and then cut to a close up of what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victims head i dont know what else to say about this gem except that if you like bad films it doesnt get any worse than this,1,0,positive,
inspector dirty harry callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of san francisco however he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city which leads him to the trail of a revenge killeras an entry in the dirty harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments including the legendary go ahead make my day line that eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery very badass and it just what fans can expect from him however the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer the problem is that this killer isnt all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as harry is this really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with pardon the pun magnum forceon the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to harrys own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before but fans that were looking for another badass harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed however a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you dont mind something a little different it is a good movie for fans 710rated r for violence and a rape scene,1,-1,positive,

bela lugosi as god transvestites discussed in a movie in the straightlaced 1950s by golly this must be an ed wood filmwatching this movie i felt a combination of guilt pleasure and nausea all at the same time the story is about glen ed wood himself and his crossdressing alterego glenda somehow if this movie were made now i could see kevin kline playing glenglenda notice how all the crossdressers alter egos are versions of their male name glenglenda robertroberta etc it attempts to sympathetically portray it as the mental disorder that it is rather than as a graphic perversion somehow wood manages to sneak in bondage and sm sequences into his initial story of glenglenda along with these racy scenes satan himself shows up obviously having a bad hair day the dialog and pace are nonexistent but the film is enjoyable in its context the weird world of ed woodsterno says put on your favorite lace panties for this one,0,0,negative,
bridgess drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the safety precautions taken at a nuclear powerplant is directed well and a pretty interesting film from the late 70s its not amazing but its solid the acting is pretty good especially jack lemmon but douglas and fonda were good too it was a pretty good screenplay and bridgess direction was solid and suitable this is definitely not one of the best films of the 70s but its one of the better ones a good early michael douglas film and lemmon in his prime imdb rating 72 my rating so in simple words solid but not amazing thats what this film is solid but not amazing 810,1,1,positive,
this is probably my least favorite episode i lived in cape girardeau for quite some time i can tell you there is no ocean or shrimp boats fresh crab or scallops anywhere near missouri cape girardeau is the only inland cape its on the mississippi river it looked like the license plates were from mississippi which may explain why there was so much racial tension missouri and mississippi are 2 completely different states that dont touch one another there are many roads in and out of town and none of them are route 6 or route 666 this whole inaccuracy was very distracting also cassie did not seem like someone who would want to hang around dean if she was well educated i did not buy them as a couple and didnt enjoy the lengthy love scene jo was more deans style,0,-1,positive,
i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs 2 or 3 episode collections or when scifi would rerun the episodes however when scifi would host the reruns they generally stuck to the same episodes there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didnt repeat does anyone know exactly how long this series ran it says 1985 to 1987 at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years if you loved the twilight zone night gallery and outer limits you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase,1,1,positive,
when we started watching this series on cable i had no idea how addictive it would be even when you hate a character you hold back because they are so beautifully developed you can almost understand why they react to frustration fear greed or temptation the way they do its almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of christophers learning curvesi cant understand why adriana would put up with christophers abuse of her verbally physically and emotionally but i just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior carmella has a dream house endless supply of expensive things but im sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband or maybe not thats why i watchit doesnt matter how many times you watch an episode you can find something you missed the first five times we even watch episodes out of sequence watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language ae with language censored reruns on the movie network whenever theyre on were there weve been totally spoiled nowi also love the malaprops an albacore around my neck is my favorite of johnny boy when these jewels have entered our family vocabulary it is a sign that i should get a life i will when the series ends and i have collected all the dvds and put the collection in my will,1,-1,positive,
i went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it it lacked authenticity and believability some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was adlibbed perhaps this is typical of woody allen excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard it wasnt even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself the acting reminded me of seinfelds acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes they are corny but if you dont take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the actors not the characters if youre looking for a random movie and you like woody allen id definitely recommend it,1,-1,neutral,
he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator in this case portraying attorney and murderer tom capanokathryn morris is sympathetic as victim anne marie fahey but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim we are sorry for the situation but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women including rachel ward as wellthe sad part is where she is actually getting help with her selfesteem issues and capano actually had her psychologist killed pretty hard to believe but this was based on a true storythere is a cameo with olympia dukakis excellent as capanos mother all in all an interesting story because it is based on a true murder and you will want to read ann rules book to get the accurate details 810,1,1,positive,
this movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay at a house to get money by renovating it and then they find out that the house has a woman deamon in it and that there is a portal to hellin this movie there are heaps of stupid scenes like at the start of the movie how they are cleaning the house and they start to dancing to a cheesy song and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the professor gets his face ripped ofi only hired this movie because i am a big fan of horror movies and its only worth watching if u are a fan of horror moviesthe acting in this movie is really bad the only good actor is roy scheider from the great movie jaws and over all this movie has heaps of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10,0,-1,positive,
it has carla gugino yay and a crappy ending boo jaded is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun but one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down she is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital after that we spend the rest of the movie watching her attempting to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn some new info about who she is and where she comes from and a bit about her pastdirector and cowriter caryn krooth does an excellent job with this movie considering its uber low budget it handheld and sometimes looks like 16mm but it fits the movie since the story demands a harsh look to it the actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and theres not really anything to complain about it the standout feature in the movie is of course carla gugino who bares it all in this movie she is actually more nude in this movie than she is in sin city christopher mcdonald is also in the movie but his character is really kinda pointless but he is fun to watch i didnt really pay much attention to the music since it doesnt really draw attention to itself but it gets the job done with what its got the movie is r rated and its that for a very good reason its very sexual and very graphic at times its essentially borders on soft core at times but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie so it doesnt feel like its just there for the sake of being there although there is one pointless scene where we see chris mcdonald getting it on that scene was a tad pointless but its not really much of a problem i guess the only fault with the movie is that we dont get to see the court trial after all that we go through in the movie its like having sex and not having an orgasm or something its a shame that the talented caryn krooth has never made a feature film since this this is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget i really hope that she gets back in the game soon because she is an amazing director jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema instead what we have is an enjoyable movie that shows a great director in the makinghide the kids and close the curtains you dont want people to think youre watching porn whiles watching this movie,1,1,positive,
not everyone likes this movie it is still one of the best you have to be thinking movies about satanism ever made the fact that it doesnt have mtvera jump cuts or gore every seven minutes is irrelevant also speaking as someone who actually knows satanists the spoiler warning portion of the film where the brotherhood exchange their old bodies for those of preadolescent children it has some genuinely scary scenes the section where second spoiler alert strother martin orchestrates the changeover is almost hyperreal in that it uses very few special effects a hallmark of this film mceveety was seldom given a big budget but was often effective it worked in this case too,1,-1,positive,

one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romanceadventure holywood movies as if those werent reason enough to love it anyone who after seeing this movie complains about connerys accent or the lack of historical verisimilitude or the realism of the political motivations or any other extramovie concerns simply doesnt love movies see it and be awed by the starpower of the two leads the exotic romantic photography and music and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film this is proof that hollywood can make em like they used to when it really wants to a solid 810,1,-1,positive,

the best of everything just what is the best of everything it is different for everyone but for most of us it is love but alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love this story goes the whole gambit of looking for love sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons but as the saying goeswe are the captains of our own ships and so it goes for our lives we are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives once we make those choices then we must live with them as we watch this story and as we see these women making choices that most likely change their lives forever we wonder would we make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser who knows,1,-1,positive,
its hard to comment on this movie its one of the few movies dimension actually has not shelved its hard to come up with a reason why and it was rushed into a an unimpressive 500 theaters its opening day maybe dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using his tow truck to pull a house apart piece by pieceray sawyer is just a tow truck driver until he rescues a voodoo priestess from a bad car accident and in return he gets attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowns at the morgue ray comes back to life and stalks a group of teenagers who witnessed the awful crash occur what brings this movie down is its paper thin characters i didnt care for one moment about any of them also the dialog was less than hohum also it was very predictable characters did the typical stupid horror movie character things like check creaky noises call out peoples names and trip on a rock while being chased i also could immediately pick out who the final girl would be and why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever somebody died or whenever the killer was shownwhats good well there is an impressive suspense scene where the killer walks underneath swamp waters to get to his victims and a tense sequence where the final girl must camouflage herself with bunch of other dead bodies while the killer looks onbut other than that its another augustseptember disappointment i was looking forward to it but i did not get what was expected,0,0,negative,

house of games is a flawlessly constructed film and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger eberts review which proclaimed it the best film of 1987 i had my doubts mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year boy was i in for a surprise this was one of the smartest most wellwritten movies i had ever seenthe screenplay is quite a piece of work not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out but also in terms of character development on my second viewing i began to realize that mamets screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations the climax of the movie is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable it stems naturally from what we know about the characters and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset their work plus mamets extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s it is truly a mustsee,1,1,positive,

after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in aro he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villarongarecommended,1,-1,positive,

the star packer is one of about 152000000 westerns that john wayne acted in during the 1930s well the number is a bit exaggerated but it seemed almost like this many this is because these bmovies were quickly made with very low budgets in order to be the second or lesser feature in a theater most bs were pretty cheap and tended to cut corners to keep down costs and the star packer is no exception to save on costs incidental music is not used running times were kept to under an hour the writing was often rather derivative and the actors are mostly lesser talentsand wayne himself was definitely far from being a household name at this time some of these wayne features are pretty good while others like this one are watchable but also rather silly and inconsequential i enjoyed this film and most of the others but its probably because i cut bs a lot of slackwayne stars as john traversa us marshall investigating the actions of a local gang out to chase locals out and steal from the stage this is odd as the film was apparently set in the modern time or close to it as they used telephones and modern machine gunsthings you just wouldnt expect to find in the old west such anachronisms are actually pretty common in b westernsas gene autry films for example abound with them waynes sidekick is yakplayed by stuntman and real life friend of wayne yakima canuttthe bad guy is an unknown figure referred to as the shadow and he dispenses his instructions through a black screen that hides his face this sounds exactly like a character from a movie serialthe sort of baddie that kids loved but grownups groaned at because they were so silly and at bit like blofeld or dr evil the problem is if you listen to his voice and pay any attention at all it becomes obvious early in the film that this shadow is george hayes now speaking of hayes this is the same guy who later in films was known as gabby hayes but here and in several other of waynes early films he looks and acts nothing like gabby in the star packer he was well dressed articulate and cleanshavenimagine that in real life apparently this was more the real george hayesthough i doubt that he was evil now as you can tell from the last paragraph that there really is no mystery in this film you are left with acting passable and nothing more and stuntswhich were actually pretty amazing again and again one amazing stunt after another occurredsuch as men jumping from horse to horse and some great fight scenesall done by the way by canutt and his friends canutt was often john waynes double in filmsand this went on for decades the problem with some of the stunts however is that it appears that the film makers actually killed a few horses to get those great stumbling horses bits seen later in the film up until about 1940 film makers often strung thin metal wire and ran horses across it at full gallop in the process the horses legs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently euthanized one of the worst examples of this was the film jesse jameswhere several horses were brutally killedleading to the american humane association insisting that a representative of the organization be on film shoots to certify that animals are not hurt in the production so since about 1940 films bear this little disclaimer the star packer was made well before the disclaimer and i cant see how the horses did these tricks without being killedoverall this is at best a timepasser due to a poor plot occasionally poor acting and an unbelievable cruel attitude towards the horses i am no bleeding heart but just cant understand this disregard for a poor old animal,0,0,positive,

ill tell you a tale of the summer of 1994 a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie and it was a whos who of the top canadian bands of the age we got there about 4am waited in line most of the morning and when the doors opened at 9am we were among the first inside the gates we then waited and waited in the hot sun slowly broiling but we didnt care because the headliners were among our favourites at one point early in the afternoon i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics tshirt this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day theres nothing reasonable nor tastedetermined nor really anything except their fandom snotty of me isnt it so i in my hatred of the band have denied myself the delight that is whale musicdesmond howl had it all its hard to say what hes lost since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams phantoms and his own past until the day a teenaged criminal breaks inand trite as it sounds breaks him outcanadian cinema suffers from several problems generally a lack of money as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian leads to lower production values than american or british films and most people dont like to watch anything that sounds or looks like well not like an american film next canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story and tell it well third they seem to think that gratuitous nudity often fullfrontal makes something artistic im sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies especially late at night on the cbc knows exactly what im talking about its almost like a dont do this handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian filmmakers threw it out a long time agoin the 90s and 00s however some films such as bruce mcdonalds work and the brilliant crazy have broken this mold and managed to maintain what makes them canadian while holding onto watchable production values and great stories whale music is such a film on the surface deeper than just its canadianisms its a deeply moving story of a man whos lost his grip through grief and excess who is redeemed by music then by love and that redeems even the rheostatics,1,1,positive,
one of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly touted as an inname only sequel theres nothing wrong with that except this the return of chevy chase as ty webb this connects the viewer to this character from the original caddyshack in 1980 and makes fans thinking or wanting caddyshack ii to be similar to the first onethere are rumors that rodney dangerfield was supposed to return he carried a big part of the first film so his return would have put caddyshack 2 over the top jackie mason is the new rodney for this movie and does a decent job even though their comic deliveries are way different dan aykroyd was great but not in the film enough he should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time bill murray got in the first one robert stack airplane was good in the new ted knightvillian role we miss you ted danny noonan should have been back so many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did instead the characters involved rather than the club itself should have been the main focus like they were in the first one when you watch this film keep in mind that it isnt a major sequel and you may think its another good or bad eighties comedy fans of the first should see it but dont be shocked when the comparisons between the original and part ii are so far apart,1,-1,positive,

the gymnast unfolds in short shots and short scenes revealing its characters and message over time the spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful simple score this intimate approach is wonderful for feeling like youre on a path of discovery as much as the characters arethe spare approach is also its drawback there are a few scenes that are confusing because they dont have enough context there are some decisions made by the characters that seemed rather flip until i watched the interviews that were in the bonus materials im glad i did because the actors descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more well rounded understanding of the film overallaside from the story itself it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies the shooting was very tastefully done very matteroffact one has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold not a voyeuristic sleaze film the physicality of the athletes their realness is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plotnot a film ill need to see again anytime soon since the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time,1,1,positive,
well it turned out as i expected visual overload but nothing else added to the original what did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick initially this awoke my interest but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns a were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical hollywoodlike product and b made the whole storyline improbable the 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward and included no timestorms or any bogus of that sort it just stated that when you come home after a long journey things might have changed a bit earth might have fallen in the hands of apes for example like many old movies its main ingredient was suspense hell does anyone understand that word these days in this burton movie an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie but at what cost surely the images are overwhelming and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete apeculture even apemusic but whats wrongfirst the suspension of disbelief is made very hard because the apes have a lot of hollywoodhuman traits i refer especially to ari and the slavetrader these traits include emotional skills like irony sarcasm and an overtly displayed array of subtle emotions it makes you forget that the apes are apes which is essentialsecond the humans talk of course we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didnt made the apehuman roleswitching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version the wound in the throat that charlton heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that dr zira has in him so no need for things like human rights activists or apehuman love in order to explain thingsthird the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility but is a necessary twist in the new movie since capt davidson has to play the hollywoodletssavethewholeworld andhaveagoodendingforeveryone andstillmakeittotheloungebar foracooldietcoke character oh my god will they never learn i new it from the start when there was only one guy who got lost they were in need of a hero and then the script writers go on reasoning we need one guy so why would one guy get lost because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm implausible but its necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes since in these modern and politically correct times we cant have a xenophobic apehater like charlton hestons 68 character loose on the screen lets give them a bubblegum versionfourth okay the general twist of the original discovering the truth of the 1968 film to the modern version he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their labapes developed their society where heston simply discovered that just somehow the apes overtook the earth while he was away is nicely done the second battlepart comes as an anticlimax thats because this movie has added the first two planet of the apes movies in one plot nice try but the chill you feel when davidson and you discover that hes lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battlepartfifth the ending for chrissakes who came up with that a davidson crashes twice with his escape pod which seems an unsteerable object while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully come on whod believe that if the pods are really small space crafts davidson simply flies off into space at the end and not merely escape vessels he might have managed a safe landing at least once no and what about that ending i mean in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth but here the whole movie takes place on a distant planet and suddenly the same theres a thade statue ape culture is on earth how come did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically flew into the time storm and colonised earth before davidsons mission took off why is thade worshiped stupid stupid stupidhelena bonham carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape but id expected no less i preferred her ape above estella warren as a human but maybe i got some loose wire in my head nevertheless the only convincing apes were tim roth as thade wonderful and aris household ape the exgeneral but i forgot his namenonono a lot of things could and should have been addedaltered to the 1968 pic but not the plot at least not in that way it was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining it was nicely tonguein cheek and caricatured dont stylize everything,0,1,positive,

i liked this movie a lot it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things other than that it was great,1,1,positive,
this movie caught me by surprise for years i have avoided many of harold lloyds sound pictures as well as those of keaton because they have a generally welldeserved reputation for being lousy compared to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost however when i saw this film i was pleasantly surprised to find i actually liked itonce i accepted it really was not a harold lloyd film despite him starring in it this is because although it is nothing like the style of his earlier films it is highly original and lloyd isnt bad playing a totally different type of characteras i mentioned above the formula of the old films is almost completely missing here lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances and the plot is just plain weird instead of the usual roles he is the son of a chinese missionary who returns to america for the first time since he was a small boy because of this though he looks like an american except for his white suit and explorers helmet he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is chinese in many ways hes very naive about america and is like an innocent among wolves early on he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss this boss always produces a losing candidate for the mayoral racebecause he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a token candidate who has no chance of winning well the old geezer who they traditionally run for office just died and he decides to run the naive lloydhe hasnt a prayer of winning well the unthinkable happens and lloyd wins this and lloyds decision to clean up the town greatly upsets the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy honest lloyd just when it appears lloyd is headed to jail on a trumped up corruption charge he creates a scheme that is 100 impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from the crooks however despite this it is incredibly funny and a great ending so my advice is at the end just suspend disbelief and enjoyan important note this movie is definitely not politically correct the word chink is used repeatedly i found it offensive but considering the times i ignored it as you should too if however you are someone who cant and like being angry i suggest you never watch movies anywayas you are bound to become offended again and again,1,-1,positive,
this film is so different to anything you would have seen before its an honest and chilling account of an entire familys battle with a terminal illness the closer she gets is shot in a very unique style craig oulette films in a very different way using different angles and viewpoints in what i find is a very eye catching manner perhaps due to his experience with photographic works his style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient herself is facing but what loved ones close to her also have to deal with a very sad but extremely interesting and unique film one i would definitely suggest watching,1,-1,positive,
i dont really know where to start the acting in this movie was really terrible i cant remember seeing so many actors in one film that werent able to act not only the acting was bad the characters were incredibly stupid as wellthen theres the action i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot theres blood involved but when someone gets shot in snitchd for ten times theres no blood at all well i guess thats just meto make a long story short because believe me i can go on for hours about this film this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw this film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt,0,0,negative,
the first sidestory in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyesthe story does contain some gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christinawar in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here this short 6 episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a gundam seriesnormally watching anime in japanese or english i would leave up to personal preference but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one not only do the characters whom all except alfred are caucasian sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramasin short this show does not try to impress the audience what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given,1,0,positive,
okay i didnt get the purgatory thing the first time i watched this episode it seemed like something significant was going on that i couldnt put my finger on this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my attention and it helped that i was just writing an essay on inferno but let me see what hasnt been discussed yeta twop review mentioned that tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator yeah 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons especially religious but heres one more for ya on a hunch i consulted wikipedia and guess what dante divided into 7 levels purgatorio excluding antepurgatory and paradise the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and what tony cant get to on to the allegedly random monkslap scene as soon as the monks appeared it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of purgatory you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial death disease and sin came on and hes getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him by the time he meets the monks hes thinking hey maybe these guys can help me which sounds like contemplating other religions eg buddhism and wondering if some other path could take him to salvation not that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a buddhist but it appears finnerty tried that and messed up that slap in the face basically tells tony theres no quick fix as in no you cant suddenly embrace buddhism and get out of here tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven but at the conference entrance he realizes thats not going to be so easy for him at first i saw the name vs drivers license problem as tony having led sort of a double life what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people he feels free to have an affair with quasimelfi because hes kevin finnerty he figures out that he can fool some people with kfs cards like hotel receptionists but it wont get him out of purgatory those helicopters the helicopters of heaven are keeping track of him and everything he doesafter reading all the theories on infinnerty though it seems like kfs identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths tony couldve taken in his life possibly along with the car joke involving infinitis that made no sense to me otherwise aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out,1,-1,positive,
after spotting the high rating on imdb i decided to go see this movie beyond that high rating i intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews i wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectationsgiven my rating you can see that i was disappointed i enjoyed the development of the main character mike enslin i also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room by the time enslin entered the room i was ready for some scary stufffirst chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded enslin reacts in a believable manner hes freaked out im encouraged and think to myself this is going to be good the people who made this movie understand that less is morebut its what happens next that was a big let down the subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach just blast the audience with every hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works lets see a clock radio that turns on by itself good thats always scary objects that move around in the room good you cant complain about that blood dripping from the walls and sink great ghosts that commit suicide good anything else how about loud noises shaking fire more shaking messing up the room more blood etc etc its all good and its all been done before overstimulate our attention deficit disordered audience with all kinds of stuff in quick succession and they wont be able to look awaywell it didnt work for me and you know what else when i go see a horror movie in a theater its typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments but this movie had no scary moments the audience was silent and disinterested i felt no chill down my spine nothing the shining was 100x what this movie tries to beso who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever friends of the director sorry i just dont get it,0,1,positive,
have i seen a worse movie perhaps only manos the hands of fate dragged more than dukes i had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point lets touch on a fewthere was a noticeable script death and rebirth when sheev is talking to the dukes and they dont respond he shrugs and moves on since neither the knoxville or scott know what hes talking about nor do we it was like the engine died and was restartedthe few times the general lee flew through the air werent even that exciting nothing i havent seen on the tv seriesvery little chemistry between knoxville and scott the best part was when bo is upset at luke for stealing the girl he liked the only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it although roughly the rest of the time it seems distant and forcedseann william scotts awful horrendous accent or lack thereofi hated willie nelsons performance were bad jokes supposed to be endearing i wanted him to disappearjessica simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film thats telling you how horrible this movie is shes a goddessduring the climax of the film i was rooting for boss hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of hazzard county starting with willie nelson and his accomplices a nuclear bomb would have sufficedthis is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming filmif only we could erase and start over,0,0,positive,
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face im a christian and liked the film in one way it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see it can be a bit longwinded but the film has some quite nice cars that rescues it from a lower rating from me as a christian film it was quite good but maybe a bit righton in the message the film works best on a big screen spoilers the fighting scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fighting scene between the two brothers in the christian thriller mercy streets starring eric robertsend of spoiler i give it a 710,1,-1,positive,
the third and final installment of hanzo the razor is the most concrete of them all the training even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film not for everyone this film details hanzos investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks it also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old japan to incorporate western technology where the first hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to its plot hanzo 3 whos got the gold manages to connect everything and brings it all home in the end definitely the perfect finale oh yeah hanzo still has a lot of sex and theres a lot of needless blood and violence it is hanzo the razor after all,1,-1,positive,
i truly despair for womankind when they discuss this joke of a programme as if its intellectually engaging and promotes female liberation and independence this show is the biggest insult to women next to all those libidinous hiphop videos if talking like a bunch of reckless teenage boys over 100 lunches in swanky restaurants indiscriminately shopping for unnecessary fashion and jumping into bed with the nearest male in site is considered empowering the fate of western women may be doomed as we speakaside from the damage it does to the female gender sex and the city is not entertaining not once has it been funny captivating exciting or original the episodes play out monotonously each character are factory produced mannequins who behave in the same manner every episode not once have any of these shallow unattractive women evolved perhaps the worst is lead character carrie bradshaw aside from looking hideous her penchant for over analysis of relationships is cringe worthy on top of all this the show portrays men as a bunch of empty headed slobs who are unable to commit to healthy relationships even when there is a decent man he is somehow painted as a villain the utter lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some progressive pseudo feministsaddest part of the whole show is that these women live unfortunate miserable lives any intelligent woman would never envy them it is a banal show with even more banal characters the nyc tourist board must hate the way this garbage is showing up their otherwise fine city thankfully this train wreck is over desperate housewives is seen as the fitting replacement for satc while dh can be quite farfetched at least it explores women in more multifaceted ways plus it treats men more respectfully and its actually entertaining,0,0,negative,
what is often neglected about harold lloyd is that he was an actor unlike chaplin and keaton lloyd didnt have the vaudevillemusic hall background and he wasnt a natural comedian he came to hollywood to act and he discovered he had a knack for acting funny first in shorts then in features he made a name for himself as lonesome luke a chaplin knockoff with the glasses character that made him the allamerican boy rather than a grotesque lloyd found his stride and his movies became some of the best produced during the silent erahe developed a reputation as a daredevil in some shorts and retained this in some of his best movies safety last for heavens sake girl shy he was more popular than either chaplin or keaton during the twenties and he became very rich before the advent of soundthe first sound movies were often disasters to get the most out of their sound too much dialog was used in many movieslloyds acting skills were after two decades geared for silents he didnt have a bad voice its high pitch suited his glasses character and his sound films werent the unqualified disasters of legend yet silent movies had been raised to a high art especially lloyds which did not stint on budget and were extremely wellcrafted with the introduction of talkies movies had to learn to walk again and they made some misstepsthough he tried to move with the times and embraced sound lloyds best bits from his early overly talky talkies were still visual such as the scene in movie crazy where he appears to be riding in a swank car but actually hitched a ride on his bicycletrying to recapture the daredevil antics that made him famous as he did in feet first was misstep in safety last his best movie and the one that deservedly or not shoved lloyd in the box as a daredevil comic he played a determined young man climbing to the top safety last had a natural structure that ascended to his characters scaling the side of the building he was obviously afraid but his fear added to the humor in feet first he arrived in a precarious buildingscaling position by accident his frantic cries for help detracted from the humor his character was pathetic and cringing aspiration to save his neck possibly an accurate statement of the 1930s but not amusingharold lloyd was not mired in the past like some wacky norma desmond he embraced sound and tried to take his movies in different directions growing and changing with the industry when feet first failed he left the daredevil business and made a satire on the talking movie industry movie crazy just as he had to flounder through many movies as lonesome luke before carving his place in movie history with the glasses character he had tried several directions in sound movies before hitting his stride in sound which he did with the catspawin the catspaw he plays a missionarys son reared in china who unwittingly gets elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests when he finds out the truth he sets himself the task of cleaning up the town only in his early forties lloyd could still act the brash young manyet the catspaw was another boxoffice failure and lloyd made only three more movies including the milky way of his chief competitors chaplin still had silent movies in him and keaton was hopelessly mismanaged the catspaw and the milky way suggest lloyd might have mastered sound comedy if he had been a little younger or if audiences had given him the benefit of the doubt after his early sound fiascoesthough the movie has been unfairly maligned about the way lloyds character cleaned up the town it suits him from his days in shorts lloyd wanted to scare his audience and the climax of the catspaw achieved it yet again in a surprising way until the trick is revealed it appears gruesome and then come the laughsviewed as a product of its time the catspaw is charming and funny a very wellwritten sound comedy wellacted by lloyd directed by sam taylor its curious blend of drama and sly humor make it look almost like a frank capra or preston sturges comedy,1,0,positive,
i want to say the acting is bad but i think it was the directing that made it so i never thought much of highlander same director but that one could be blamed on the 80sthis one however has no excuses people get shot while exiting trenches with a man in front of him those kind of mistakes along with an unclear time line weird battle tactics subpar cutting and poor visual effects makes this one a subpar film over allthen like so many other have commented all this american bullshit the german general being practically scared of his captured american private be prepared to swallow a lot of it although in small dosesto sum it up a not horrible but still definitely subpar war movie in all aspects,0,0,negative,

im sorry guys all who thought this film could be something great im afraid you would be disappointedthe standard the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot so simple that the movie is not evolving until the end i asked myself if the plot wasnt about the action but about the main character played by mickey rourke but i found that the character was inconsistent either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother but both dont go together because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself now joseph gordonlevitt is a good looking actor but he played his character a little unnatural i didnt believe his acting it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldnt provide and he didnt have to because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough the only one whose acting was great was diane lane if not her i would give this movie 1 starin conclusion i expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot and i completely blew it with my high expectations,0,1,positive,

it probably isnt fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten but oh wellfrom a standpoint of acting how could any actor fail with these characters each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life tony sopranowhile a mob capo and suffering from mental illness still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive each of his men you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism it definitely brings out a sort nosey side in each and every viewer and i include myself in thiswhile some above dont care for bracco i have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since good fellas she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason that makes him decent that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long if ever she is simply put his savior not speaking in religious tonesbut the knockout performance here is without doubt edie falco to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series oz and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress she has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress something only actresses like merle streep can get away with a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles but as i have mentioned before with a characters a strong as these how can any actor faillivias strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself she is a survivor as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors she is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husbands business yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey she is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then tony himselfall in all the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january 2000 to see the next season this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series it was what brought the larry sanders show sex and the city dream on and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them too much space in between seasons and very sporadic until then i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled,1,0,negative,

two years ago at sundance i loved josh kornbluths directing debuthaiku tunnel so i was looking forward to his brother and frequent collaborator jacobs the best thief in the world this is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lowerclass area of new york the movie is not without its poignant moments but at times it is as if kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious life can be very difficult for some people and life isnt fairmore subtle and more important is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the antisocial behavior they may spawn these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity we can recoil at their language and their living conditions but we are cannot discount their intent and in fact their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and his compassion for the people is evident throughouthaving said all this the best thief in the world suffers from many painful flaws including the title the characters arent very believable the writing is uneven and the plotline is barely discernible and for many the most disturbing is that kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes to each his own but while i dont question the potential realism of this phenomenon it pains me to see 5yearold children mfing and talking about having sex with a lineup of women its unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest,0,-1,positive,
normally i dont like chuck norris films i appreciate his work as a martial artist and his fight scenes are usually fairly wellchoreographed chuck is undeniably one of the martial arts greats so in my local used bookstore i found a film i hadnt seen before and took it homewhile the acting in this movie was worse than most chuch norris films i was hoping to see at least one fight scene i quickly began to realize that this wasnt a typical chuch norris film rather it was a christian film destined to illustrate the good will win out paradigmthere is really nothing on the packaging to indicate that this is a christian film with the exception of the label goodtimes entertainment which i had never heard of before ill certainly keep that in mind the next time i see a film from that companyi dont have a problem with christianity i do have a problem with sneaky proselytizing if someone is going to make a religious film at least have the good sense to indicate to the viewer that such is what they will get the only redeeming part about the exercise is that i spent only 325 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight at least it was during suppertime and i spent some of that cooking and eatingin short if youre looking for a mediocre martial arts film and not hoping for much dont bother with this film because it doesnt even offer that,0,1,positive,
sadly this movie is not very good but does it really matter we all know the basics for the story and this has nothing new but i love low budget horror sci fic camp classics so i forgive this one about thew only thing that anyone remember from this movie is that little leonardo dicaprio made his debut in ithe did ok the part didnt ask for great acting skills and the direction probably never gave him any chance of providing one anyway little leonardo dicaprio was very cute and so was the girl the movie is fun if you like horror sci fic camp classics and are experienced in watching them,0,1,positive,
intervention has helped me with my own addictions and recovery im a middleaged married father of two im quite functional in my personal and professional life still i have pain from my past that i use addictions to soothe and issues from which i am slowly recovering when these addicts and their families share their lives with me they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my familythe show unlike many others digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction many of us suffer because its too scary to go back and do as alice miller says the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started this digging is painful and difficult but worth it so much coverage of addiction fictional and nonfictional seems to ignore the underlying issues often its assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or selfinterest and now they cant stop not so addictions are about killing pain i can relate to the different events and hardships in peoples lives there are common themes and surprising exceptions many addicts have suffered miserable abuse some kids simply respond badly to divorce to those who think that addiction is an overreaction to a hardship i would just say that different people respond differently although some kids handle divorce well others like cristy in the show collapse in a heap on the floor and have their lives forever changed by the eventfor example last nights counselor said that pretty young andrea seeks validation from men she strips for cash for a 75year old neighbor and lets men abuse her sound familiar to anyone the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives often its those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest as they say even a stopped watch is right twice a day but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while until its made your life miserableto the producers thank you for making the show for digging into the past for the followups also the graphics the format and the theme music are brilliantto the addicts thank you for your courage to share whether or not you have helped yourself you have helped me,1,-1,positive,
directorwriter andrs waissbluth worked seven years to complete this two hour film about the crime underground in santiago chile and perhaps that is one of the reasons the resultant film seems episodic and in need of editing or maybe this is the technique of a director who shows a fine sense of film noir storytellingtwo brothers silvio the elder nstor cantillana and victor the younger juan pablo miranda have moved to santiago from their home in temuco after their parents death and silvio works to support victors education on victors seventeenth birthday silvio takes the virgin out to the clubs where he encourages victor to lose his virginity with one of the clubs stripperprostitutes in a tender scene victor must face his nascent impotency while silvio is out on the club floor impressing the owners with his potential for hiresilvio goes to work for the gang as a bodyguardhenchman and makes good money to support victors schooling but victor has eyes for one of the dancers at the club named gracia antonella ros and begins to woo her dropping out of school incurring silvios angry disappointment gracia just happens to be the squeeze of the club gangs leader don pascual alejandro trejo who is silvios boss gracia is the glue that holds this tale together as she is the paramour of victor silvio and don pascual and the consequences of this bizarre mnage a trois has deadly results through a means of retelling the story through the eyes of victor silvio and gracia we grow to understand the vulnerabilities and the cracks in each character that allow for the downfall that resultssound like a chilean pulp fiction well it is and it is filmed in a brutally colorful dark manner that includes a lot of frontal nudity both female and male and provocative sexual encounters but in the end the sensual aspect of the directors vision is what drives this film playing on the debutante virginal psyche against the hardcore professional sex worker with success the cast is fairly strong especially antonella ros in the demanding role of gracia there are enough twists and turns and replays of incidents you think you understood the first viewing but that change dramatically in impact when told through the eyes of a different character bordering on two hours some judicious editing would have helped the impact of the film in spanish with english subtitles recommended for those who like the edgy film noir style and the art of south american cinema grady harp,1,-1,neutral,
i enjoyed a lot watching this movie it has a great direction by the already know bigas luna born in spain and it is precisely in spain that the movie takes place in catalua to be more preciseluna explores once more the theme of an obcession in this case the obcession of a young boy for the womens milk there are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother in the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mothers milk go to the recently born son so he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him he finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around thisthis movie lives a lot on imagery more than the story itself the espectator captures certain moments unforgettable moments and certain symbols the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something the surroundings the landscapes typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters also symbolic and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by nicola piovani transport us to another dimension not parallel to the real world but which intersects it from times to times worth living in that world worth watching this movie even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession which is perhaps taken beyond the limitsi also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist 810,1,1,positive,
i love the other reviews of this movie they mirror my attitude i am a 70s sort of guy minus disco and star wars childishness there was nothing great about this movie except for a chase scene that is why it was good because it was tough basic and economical roy scheider carried the movie which was based on the crew the 7 ups that backed up gene hackman in the french connection the people in it were believable and average who burned themselves pouring coffee showed fear in chase scene and almost lost it after a close call crashmaybe it would be easier to tell you what it lacked there was no fancy weapons just basic revolvers and crude sawed off shotguns there was no tough guy philosophizing ala tarantino there was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick shooting either there was no clever guy who carries out some complicated scheme based on hundreds of things going just the way he planned including everyone elses reactions the criminals were bad guys but they didnt shoot people for the hell of it as a matter of fact there was a body count of just three something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits it could be a g movie today no bus load of orphan school children were kidnapped nor were terrorists threatening to kill half of the city there were no high tech hijinks nor were the crimes themselves very moving or ingenious the highest tech thing i saw was a touch tone att wall phone it had no subplots or amusing character developments also no sex or women except for one mobsters wife who did some screaming as the buddy our hero had her menacedit was some little undertaker who exploited his connections with the local mob and the police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy payoffs the undertakers vito was played by tony lo bianco who did a great job as good as roy schneider buddy the head of 7 ups cop whom he informed and exploited what ever happened to tony lo bianco he seemed like a pacino shoe in good looking and talented what it did have was a great nyc backdrop to a simple crime story locations that were bleak and dehumanizing without being a sociological study it had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme where one of buddys cop got accidentally involved literally accidentally dragged in then accidentally shot dead since buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dogs unit both the nypd brass and mobsters thought he was involved since the kidnappers masqueraded as plain clothes cops to lure the mobsters into compliance obviously the mobsters figured they had lawyers and rights to protect them from normal police even the mobsters were plain old and ugly no godfather royalty or soprano hipness hereit is a good basic movie with a standout chase scene between two 70s d pontiacs even the cars were plain and economical not even a gto or a trans am like the acting and the story in the days of batman uberhype or 24 levels of intensity doomsday scenarios this movie reminds us that less is better it should be shown to movie screen writers and directors as a caveat not to dazzle amuse then ultimately insult us with stunts gadgets and clown psychotic behavior galore,1,-1,positive,
in 1979 lucio fulci released his film zombi however due to the earlier import of george romeros dawn of the dead which had gone by that name for its italian release it was retitled to zombi 2 which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second romero movie continuing this theme the second zombi film which would have been called zombi 2 was then consequently titled zombi 3 in the uk the original zombi film that is zombi 2 was titled zombie flesh eaters to continue this theme the second zombi film zombi 3 was then titled zombie flesh eaters 2 for its uk release are you following all this so if zombie flesh eaters was fulcis dawn then is 2 his day of the dead while this is only a flippant observation this tale of military compounds helicopters and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague thematic resemblancesome of fulcis european direction compels in a film like this but the acting dubbing and expositionheavy script are absolutely horrendous its ecological message is so forced and overstated it can no longer be considered a subtext while theres an unintentionally hilarious birds homage combining this last element with mor 80s rock is not a good idea for some reason i couldnt stop thinking of time of the apes qv the whole time i was watching this this is obviously not a good thingwhile theres nothing here to rival topless scubadiving shark wrestling zombies and eyeballs on a splinter fulcis misogynistic leanings do get a work out with a hotel cleaners mouth being ground into a mirror until it gushes blood his fannish gore predilections also see a hand severing both themes are combined when a womans face is ripped off first by one zombie then a zombie foetus that tears out of a pregnant womans stomachproductionwise this is obviously a step up from zombi coming five years later nine years in worldwide release terms but without the originals lowkey charm it struggles while stefano mainettis music is inappropriate and uninspired fabio frizzis score was one of the best things about the 79 movie here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds unnervingly like bonnie tylers holding out for a hero in the middle of this carnage we get an irksome love interest and roger and kenny two bland macho types who do everything with acrobatic urgency and constantly state the obvious were out of ammunition to a stalling gun is a particular standout but where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves low key or not fulcis original had truly magnificent rotting zombies skull faces worms in eye sockets they really were something to behold by contrast this dull followup opts for the more traditional men with a bit of paint on their faces option the climax rips off too many romero movies to even be funny while the use of the dj is a crass and cheap narrative device not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal it turns out that fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes the rest filmed by bruno mattei im fairly sure that even fulci would have balked at the ludicrous flying zombie head scene and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave unfortunately however its his name thats above the film title on releases so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a fulci film through and through on that scale then its a major setback for him for this movie commits what you imagine fulci would regard as the worst crime of all that of being boring,0,0,positive,
the tv ads for this movie showed the warlocks hitting a truck headon then getting smashed to bits and reforming on the other side of the truck i thought the special effects were good but the general style of the movie was wimpy this is the charmed tv series with three boys instead of three girlsthe big surprise for the three teens who are about to become adults is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan who is out to get them and consolidate all their power besides driving into trucks these kids can fly up the sides of houses climb out of windows push each other into stacks of garbage and make the veins in their necks pop out but if they use their powers too often they become prematurely old and feeble the father of one of the boys is evidence of this as he sits in an attic made up to look like a mummy but he is only 45 years oldthe three good warlocks are each filthy rich in his own right completely spoiled obnoxious and annoying in any public school these kids would be beaten up every day their glares and facial ticks would not cut any mustard with the boys from the hood unfortunately for all good people these charmed boys were sent to hogwarts reform school for the warlocks that couldnt get into harry potters classso what was the movie all about three teenagers acting out with each other and their girlfriends one other teenager who envies their power and money and happens to be a lost relative after a few scenes where the charmed boys show off their powers and have sex with their girlfriends the movie gets around to the unknown warlock teens revenge plot the predictable stuff happens the bad warlock ambushes various friends of the other warlocks and eventually starts attacking them too the final confrontation happens and that is about itthe special effects are not bad but nothing special if you like to see fireballs spiders and blue veins then this is a good movie to watch,0,0,negative,
evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances with the tremendous cast though one expects stellar acting but in this movie the expectations are exceeded one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family as one watches the interaction of the family members ones own family memories are immediately brought to mind this is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book usually it is the other way around one reads the book and then wants to see the movie i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan minot book and read it the rhode island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles needless to say now but i recommend evening highly see it you will enjoy it,1,-1,neutral,

personally i regard the egyptian in an extremely favourable lightit was introduced to me by a wellknown australian movie commenter critic named bill who was renowned for his insight broad vision of people places particularly of films this movie fitted the bill perfectly i came to appreciate his commentary enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as i watched it as i was literally drawn into it minute by minute beyond his introductory comments on my initial viewing many years agoto me it was propelled layer upon layer within half an hour into an intriguing fascinating production yes i am aware of its flaws but it was so enticing the young man of idealism learning from inspired by his father the peasant treated like rubbish in his suffering the opportunistic friend however flawed but nonetheless loved by his friend the central character sinute and to be sure a flawed hero too like so many across humanity of all societies across all time but lovable worthy of love too yes i believe in a christian god but too i acknowledge the rights respect that should be due any human being of good heart who would not or will not disrespect the rights of his fellowman without just cause as such i endorse this film its presentation of a man of good heart conviction in his belief in the sungod he was devoted to such people will always be welcome in my world vision and hopefully in many more beyondso too the drama in the ensuing movie i have watched often as surely as it has touched my heart soul as surely as it seems to have infuriated critics in its era it is captivating watching the struggles grief loves of sinute the physician when i watch it again i am always reminded of my friend in heart bill the film critic who dared to oppose all the critics long ago who rubbished it he added criticism of too many critics that they make statues to honour stars on the screen or in history but they do not make statues to honour critics and beyond all this i am reminded with each viewing of a superb touching spectacle of a beautiful wellpresented drama that was not just relevant to the 1950s or some bygone era it was meant for you me across time place to every man woman child to their personal aspirations for love freedom overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding gross injustice tragedy appealing to those of simple faith of many religions that it seems too many regard as cause for war take a night off from invitations or unjust violence from bigotry judgemental attacks on others injustly executed consider the merits of this offering not to the sun god or to power that proves time again to be so transcient let this outstanding movie wash over you like waves onto a beach like the passing hands of time like life was meant to be and maybe you will find yourself carried into its world of possibilities lost offerings no more 99 out of 10,1,1,positive,
this was the next to last film appearance by jill ireland who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a wellknown actress and producer ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her thenhusband david mccallum in 1967 beginning her long relationship with charles bronson it is a great irony that bronson probably the alltime leader in number of deaths rendered onscreen had one of the most enduring marriages in film historyassassination seems to be a movie that was tucked into cannons production schedule for the sake of bronson and ireland ireland was already suffering from cancerrelated illnesses in 1987 and you can almost picture the two actors wanting to do just one more for old times sake assassination is carelessly done as a whole showing the lack of polish and dwindling funds that would tank cannon by 1990 but theres a kind of nostalgia value in seeing the couple together one last time and the film makes you wonder what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is hollywoodbronson plays jay killian a highranking secret service agent who is assigned to protect the first lady lara craig ireland the presidents wife has a reputation for being difficult bossing service agents around and wanting to do things her own way that all changes however when attempts are made on her life and she must journey with killian by car train motorbike and believe it or not dune buggy to escape wouldbe assassins there is little surprise here as killian believes the murderers are part of an inside job perhaps arranged by the president himself on the way killian and mrs craig develop an unspoken affection for one another in scenes between bronson and ireland that are actually very funnywhat really gets me is how this film was promoted upon its release and how its still made to look as a dvd the original trailer gives you the feeling that assassination is another coldhearted bronson shootemup but a lot of this movie which was rated pg13 by the way is in a comic vein putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like bronson and irelands western from noon till three even the dvd case shows bronson with a rocket launcher ready to blow things up which he does but to a lesser degree than his other 80s potboilerson the whole assassination is late cannon slop work and doesnt really know what kind of film it wants to be besides drifting from actioner to romantic thriller and back again there are serious mistakes in continuity property values are bottomofthebarrel cheap and the effects are dreadful many of the explosions seem like matte work rather than being done on location robert ragland who had shown good composing skills in earlier films teamed up with valentine mccallum on a score that is mostly synthesized and better fit for televisionrichard sales script has real lulus of dialogue with the conversations between bronson and ireland the only bright spot there is no explanation as to why the first lady is called one momma all of a sudden nor as to why ireland is left with her british accent when the character is a wyoming native jan gan boyd playing killians main assistant has a kittenlike personality and is badly miscast as a federal agent stephen elliott a former tony award nominee who died in may 2005 randy brooks erik stern as assassin bracken and michael ansara senator bunsen are acceptable in their supporting rolesincidentally this was the last film directing gig for peter hunt who broke onto the scene with on her majestys secret service in 1969 and collaborated with bronson and lee marvin on death hunt in 1981 assassination is available on dvd through mgm home entertainment it is presented in dual widescreen and standard format with threelanguage subtitles and theatrical trailer out of 4,0,-1,positive,

first of all st ives the film is only fairly loosely based on the robert louis stevenson story of the same name but for once this is not a criticism the original novel was a workinprogress unfinished at the authors death and in freely adapting it and giving it an ending the filmmakers have brought to life some endearing characters who although different from stevensons originals would i am sure have charmed and amused himit is 1813 capitaine jacques de kroual de saintyves is a breton aristocrat orphaned by the revolutions guillotine now serving as a hussar in napoleons army we meet him going out for the evening claiming that since a hussar who is not dead by 30 is a blackguard he at 34 is now on borrowed time certainly as he faces a string of challenges to duels our dashing hero seems in danger but a surreal prank on his colonel provides him a way out of the duels and into the bed of a beautiful courtesansinger unfortunately it also results in losing his commission further misadventures result in him being taken prisoner by the british and sent to a pow camp in a scottish castlewhile carving toys and boxes jacques catches the attention of flora the young niece of miss susan gilchrist a welltravelled woman of the world who lives at swanston cottage they fall in love and most of the story concerns flora helping jacques to escape and to find his emigr grandfather the old comte of course there is a problem jacques older brother alain a dissolute alcoholic is perhaps understandably far from pleased when grandfather disinherits him in front of the whole household the very instant that jacques has appeared cue treachery there is also an entertaining subplot of the romance between the awkward naf but goodhearted major farquhar chevening and aunt susan who has travelled through most of the ottoman empire and been a prisoner of the turkseven allowing for a natural prejudice in favour of any film in which the heroines share my surname st ives is magic it combines splendidly swashbuckling swordfights a balloonflight comedy and romantic adventure i would recommend it to anyone who loves the kind of film they dont make anymore fairbanks colman flynn co the acting is splendid anna friel makes flora a spirited and appealing heroine and jeanmarc barr is delightful as jacques a genuinely lovable hero miranda richardson and richard e grant are already great favourites of mine and have great fun as susan and farquhar whose relationship runs as a comic counterpoint to that of the leads as the rakish scheming but ultimately tragic alain jason isaacs shows as he did more recently in the patriot that he has the classic swashbuckling style besides the dashing good looks please please will someone cast him as a hero in the genremy main quibbles with the film concern settings and costumes in the book the castle in which jacques is a prisoner is clearly edinburgh but the film shot in ireland germany and france has highlandised the setting making the retention of place names such as swanston inveresk and queensferry decidedly incongruous the costumes too are a real hotchpotch from 1780s through to the period in which it is set while this would not be implausible with more downmarket characters making do it seems odd for welltodo ladies such as the heroines to be wearing 1780s gowns in 1813 clearly the costuming decision was sthetic these earlier styles are visually far more appealing and elegant than regency fashions and they work in the idealised world of the film as a whole st ives is 90 minutes of pure delight,1,1,positive,

this movie made me thinkof how i could write something about it without personally dissing the director and all the actors who as an australian i am proud of for actually getting out there and making a filmbut the movie itself let me tell you a storyfound this dvd in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague recollections of the reviews at the time of cinema release here so i thought i would give it a gofor some reason i decided to watch the special features before i watched the actual movie not something that i usually do turned the making of off halfway through as id had enough cringing at the arent we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw script attitudethe movie ugh full of clichs and pathetic character development the actors well done guys you are aussies and i applaud you and just like a footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them you unfortunately did not have a great script to work withi felt that the movie actually trivialised so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover i have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap agreedfinally and forgive me if i dont phrase this correctly i was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all yes we all know that life is full of hard stuff and yes we know that things such as incest do occur but i really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it i believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there somewhere otherwise the movie is all about them and their feelings they have created it for themselves not for an audiencewhich i think is the basis of why this movie isnt so great the special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting the day after he himself tried to end his own life well it may have been cathartic for him to do this however the movie reeks of selfindulgence when you know the story behind why it was written i feel horrid im going to write a movie about feeling horrid note i have read the interview with andrew urban and understand why thalluri needed to write something to help him through his own issues but i believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs and i feel that this is what has unintentionally happened hereby his own admission the director had no technical experience at all and sadly this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media projectas for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school or that all teenagers should watch it not sure there either because there is a very dangerous line at the end i too have been in a place where i have thought that someone who no longer has to face life is lucky but as an adult i do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind might be in there to promote discussion but again it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole in fact it almost indicates that there is more sadness to comei havent seen elephant but i just might go find it given all the comparisons herenothing personal here guys i do hope you can make another movie someday and we all have to start out somewhere so forgive me if ive been too harsh i am glad that you are proud of what you created which in the end is what life is all about its not a movie i would recommend thoughoh i did like the way the timeframes often collided thought that was an interesting way to film but the whole its the quiet ones you have to watch we already know that,0,1,positive,

very funny film with some of the best swedish actors its all filmed in black and white with the true 40ish feeling most of the film you are aboard a train headed for berlin in 1945 among a mixture of characters from refugees to 2 gay guys and 2 nuns i truly recommend this film if you like to laugh,1,-1,positive,
canadians are too polite to boo but the audience at the toronto film festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets the premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when druids were the spiritual leaders working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which crossdressing and assorted farcical situations arise the film could have been hilarious as a monty python piece which it too closely resembles but rohmers effort falls very flat the audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace the ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful this is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time,0,0,positive,
well at least this was the last sequel that i could find at blockbuster because this movie was just downright horrible i mean i can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil house were talking starting a horrible fire bulldozing flood etc but a mirror how hard could it be can it be to get rid of a mirror this was the most horrible movie that couldve put the title of amityville into the picture well a group of friends who are pretty much from the start are a bunch of freaks one of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy teaching me a valuable lesson dont buy things from homeless creepy guy of course the horrible deaths and chaos ensues this group though i cant imagine anyone missing themplease skip amityville a new generation ive already got a few complaints about my generation so i think this was a premonition not to sound so crazy p but believe me this is horribly acted not well thought out and not even scary i feel so bad for the original writers of the amityville horror they must be crying every time person witnesses this film110,0,0,negative,
being relatively young i didnt know how bad antisemitism was in brooklyn where my family is originally from this movie absolutely horrified me ive seen many movies about prejudice racism and antisemitism but this seemed to hit me harder than mostthis was definitely one of the best indie films ive ever seeni had to travel 45 minutes to see it and it was well worth it nearly everything about the movie was great sometimes it was a little slow but that didnt really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric it took place in the 40s and it really did look like it was the 40s the acting was greatwilliam h macy as always was wonderful so was laura dern and i was pleasantly surprised by meatloafs performance playing the vicious antisemite neighbor 910,1,1,positive,
this film is a variation of a theme weve all seen over and over again the posiedan adventure in space the characters are all stock characters feisty heroine judas coward etc etc the only question really is whos next to snuff it sometimes this tried and tested formula works like in this case but more often not like the truly mindnumbing red planet so why does this one work because its stylish the acting is above average and above all it isnt predictable the conclusion isnt signposted i really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end that alone deserves top marks in my bookits an intriguing and entertaining movie and though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it it doesnt disappoint,1,-1,neutral,
i saw this movie awhile back and cant seem to track it down does anyone know where i can get a hold of it i feel it is worth seeing againim sorry to say i had never heard of chloe nicholle until this film yes she can act when i first began to track this movie down i mistook it for another one of her movies sex spa the plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversedthis is the first film ive seen dru berrymore i looked up some of her other films and i feel she looks better as a blonde i agree this is a good introductory movie not too soft not too hard you got to start somewhere,1,-1,neutral,
two kinds of movies we like are 1 westerns and 2 movies from 30 or 40 years ago we ought to have liked a man called sledge butbut this picture is disagreeable annoying and stupid from start to finish since there is nobody in the story good or bad to warm up to there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it sledge has a pretty girl friend but theres no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this noaccount pigthe film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrowof the last 30 older movies rented from netflix or video vault this was the rock bottom the only true dud in the bunch,0,0,negative,

had the pleasure to see this film at the big bear film festival where it won the audience award and i have to say it was well deserved because boy next door is a very funny short film the script is well written and keeps things escalating it also has a great current of suspense coursing through it you dont know whats going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him the jokes are quick and unexpected the plot keeps us guessing the dialog feels very real i thought the direction was firstrate and the director travis davis shows a lot of potential for making it big in the world of studio comedies not small praise considering he also is the lead actor of the film so he had to do triple duty on this writing directing and starring if you get a chance to see this film on itunes its worth the download itll make you laugh out loud a few times and thats more than most shorts offer these days,1,1,positive,
basically caprica is the cylon origin story the premise of the show is interesting however the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many pov characters that it bogs down the storytelling the plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating what tension it might have had in any given episode little or nothing happensdaniel graystone eric stolz is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip unfortunately his only working prototype is driven by the ai version of his dead daughter zoe who died in a suicide bombing caused by soldiers of the one sto an underground monotheist extremist groupmeanwhile joseph adama father of battlestar galacticas commander adama is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the ai version of his daughter who also died in the bombing in a machiavellian virtual version of caprica which strongly resembles 1930s chicago in addition to the vapid writing caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories we already know how it ends ie the cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity,0,-1,neutral,
might contain spoilersok lets conclude this movie in one word bad two words really bad now why do i think that let me explain guttenberg leads a specialops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some armsdealer stole it from a lab they do this by attacking the armdealers in midflight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting however suspicions arise about guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name after debriefing the teammembers get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved after deciding they cant trust their bosses they decide to once again steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackersin theory this is a plot that could have worked in a lowbudget movie that just aims to be aired on tv however the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts firstly the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes second the acting is really bad or the actors are directed to act as dummys there arent many emotions change of facial expressions at all etc i was especially disappointed in guttenberg that i believe can do so much more but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough actionhero in addition though i am not by any means any expert on the subject i totally believe i could assemble a better covertops team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week this seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible this go for good guys bad guys and bystanders as well then i sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants if any of the film for example i have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and i didnt break instantlydont know how to conclude this really but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do sorry cant be any nicer than that do not watch this movie it is not even so bad it is funny 210,0,0,negative,

there were so many things wrong with this movie i have trouble keeping them all straight but one thing that really bothers me is that if jigsaw was the one laying on the ground in the bathroom what happens if zep never shows up what if zep was killed by danny gloover before he made it to the bathroom does jigsaw simply just get up and walk out could the guy in the middle of the bathroom not be jigsaw but another part of jigsaws game what if zep killed the wife and kid how does jigsaw get him the antidote for the poison if hes lying in the middle of the bathroom why does the doctor wait till the last minute to finally cut off his foot it was too late it was after six and as far as he knew his wife and child were already shot dead it wasnt the best time for heroics these are just a few questions i had about the film but i may be missing something or everything as i have only seen the movie once please help,0,-1,positive,
i ended up watching this whole very long movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people anthony quinn lawrence olivier john gielguld vittorio de sica etc would have willingly participated in this farce but maybe in 1968 people really were so naive the plot seems written by some confused latin american marxist priest with an agenda there is a superpower conflict and the russians are actually the good guys with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man who suddenly after 20 years sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a siberian gulag the priest then promptly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences we are allowed to see the secret vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imaginemeanwhile the communists in china achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death to solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war in order to justly distribute the western capitalist riches to the poor workers of chinaour good old comrade general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace they meet with the chinese leader comrade peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the chinese looked like comrade peng demands that the western capitalists must pay which is quite logical after all dont capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists and that the pope needs to sacrifice something too for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justiceso when the pope gets crowned in rome he pledges the entire wealth of the catholic church worldwide to feed our poor chinese brethren in christ and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaustapart from this there are also some minor subplots which alas provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie id give it three oscars for stupidityby the way anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope he is much more plausible as zorba the greek,0,0,negative,
the film shows relations of the dying mother and the son who is very attached to her and definitely loves her what does it show it shows their living in very poor conditions it shows how tenderly they walk really he is bringing her but what do we see further after their promenade he walks alone at the same places where they walked together it is not possible a person who love and care about another dying one would do everything to make the life of this one better he would not have a free minute to ponder to be alone with oneself and if he finds a few minutes a month for that he would run away from the places where he has usually to be another thing the author devoted this film to andrey tarkovsky we see he learned many tarkovskys visual effects but in sokurovs film they are only effects they do not support any senses or mood someone has compared this film with mirror zerkalo there is nothing common except these visual effects mirror is a great film and this one is just poor imitation,0,-1,positive,

and youd be right black mama white mama also known as women in chains is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy bmovie that the premise suggests pam grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women and this place seriously makes the summer camp where martha stewart is locked up right now look like a maximumsecurity prison its not five minutes into the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line strip em and get em wet and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college freshmans fantasy of what the inside of a sorority house is like the prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower like its a girls gone wild shoot then they all hang out together in their dorm openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape ive never been to prison myself but i have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about prisoners or guards or otherwise the biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy sorority life is that the women in this movie all wear orange cardigans and no pants go figure that say prison on the back must be those generic prison outfits for prisons that cant afford pricey accessories like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniformsand as is to be expected a prison that cant afford to put prisoner identification on the backs of the uniforms can obviously not expect to be able to find guards that are interested in guarding the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each otherthe conflict of the movies title refers to the fact that lee daniels pam grier spends much of the time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named karen as they are on the run from the cops after escaping from the prison i wont go into details about how they escape except to say that you might have seen something like it in the fugitive had they been unable to afford to stage a train wreck and it leads into the muddled story of the conflicting interests also chasing these two women for different reasons karen and lee both have their own gangs of people each hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoner and the cops are after both of them all the whilespoilers so karen is involved with a bunch of hippies that want to revolutionize life as they know it meanwhile karen just wants to get off the island something shes been trying to do for years and isnt it just perfect that they each need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to fulfill their goals so we get this odd couple pairing and since they are an odd couple its not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film but grow fond of each other by the endin a movie with so many conflicting interests especially when those conflicting interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving the rival gangs at some point in the movie not about to leave anyone unsatisfied they throw in a stupid gang standoff at the end of the movie where everyone shoots machine guns at each other killing each other en masse while the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a little boat nice even better at the end of the movie after a huge massacre in which lots of people get shot and spurt bright red paint all over the place the captain of the police looks over the masses of dead criminals covered in awful awful special effects and we learn that he will be a major before dinner not a bad way to end the movie the criminals all kill each other off and the cops get all the credit but here is the last line in the film its better to win isnt it is that why the captain is going to get promoted to major because he figured that out,0,0,positive,
i cant say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and im only saying this in comparison and it wasnt worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal though i enjoyed the coens previous work ive never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess thats why i didnt feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i dont mean to offend any of your people im sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life its hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooneywho i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect stormnaturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of itthough i dont normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesnt have that inyourface quality that the coens have shown to us in the past its a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out my score 7 out of 10,1,1,positive,

i could not agree more with the quote this is one of the best films ever made if you think vanilla sky is simply a remake you could not be more wrong there is tremendous depth in this film visually musically and emotionallyvisually because the film is soft and delicate at times early scenes with sofia and at other times powerful and intense times square postclimactic scenesthe music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly without the music the story is only half told nancy wilson created an emotional yet eclectic score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dreamlike theme although never released i was able to get my hands on the original score for about 60 if you look hard you may be able to find a copy yourself crowes other musical selections such as the beach boys josh rouse spiritualized sigur ros the monkees etcetera etcetera are also perfect fits for the film crowe has an ear for great musicmore importantly the emotional themes in this film ie love sadness regret are very powerful and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience as well as the ingenious dialogue i admit the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time againthe best part of this film however as if it could get any better is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film you will catch something newso watch closely and be prepared to think sure a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch but there is always more to the story than you thinkthis is easily cameron crowes best work and altogether a work of brilliance much of my filmmaking and musical inspiration comes from this work alone it has honestly touched my life as true art has a tendency of doing it continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is i guess to understand true art is an art itselfbottom line vanilla sky is in a league of its own,1,1,positive,

i havent read through all the comments but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be abridged im curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just didnt make much sense to me even when i rewatched them 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also poor little rich girl which was tourneurs next film is 65 minutes long and pride of the clan which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long so im relieved to see that i wasnt crazy there must be part of this film missing and thats why the resolution didnt make much senseits hard to review or comment on a movie that youre only able to see half of but i would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the insides of an east coast movie studio of the time its the earliest film ive personally seen thats based on the movie industry itself the main character is a movie star played by robert warwick who was later a mainstay hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of preston sturges films he plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on william s hart who warwick does resemble somewhat after the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl doris kenyon and convinces her to come to new jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly after that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have nowagain id recommend it to anyone whos interested in film history for the documentary value but in the form we have it doesnt hold up much as a movie and isnt a particularly good example of maurice tourneurs work,1,0,negative,

and the oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes to dwight frye seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as karloff lugosi and price and this movie proves it his character herman was one of the 2 reasons i can give to watch this movie dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire moviethe other reason is the comic relief of m eburne being in the medical profession myself i have to give kudos to the expert performance of a selfpity prone hypochondriac though other medical mistakes did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication well continue giving it to her unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie the plot is predictable with only few minor twists the filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn yes you can use too much shadowmy recommendation watch this once to see frye and eburne but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine,0,1,neutral,
the question is can a movie this entertaining really be considered a bad movie my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words vestron pictures on it vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films suburbia and class of 1984 we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was your basic plot as is follows grange this goombaesque thug from planet earth robs the bank of the moon and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet i dont even remember the planets name to mine for bauxite and other minerals the governor of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor walker a bounty hunter apparently one of only three on the whole planet reminds the prisoners that there is no escape because theres only one shuttle out of the whole planet and theyd have him to deal with then theres the nameless colonel a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare much of the movie centers around futuristic car chases dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides with explosions galore the planet itself looks suspiciously like hemet ca or one of those other dusty inland empire outposts but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid80s i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl but its definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack i cant even remember the names of the bands theyre listed in the credits other than exploding white mice because that was the only one id heard of before i saw this movie but im definitely looking into thembasically the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends,1,0,positive,
the cell is a rather difficult film to classify if you read the plot outline a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim you might think its a thriller with a touch of science fiction but that doesnt really do this movie justice there is a fantasy aspect within the subconscious minds that is stunning with lavish visuals and incredible mindtripping scenarios there is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist played by lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing and there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killers evil persona the movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will while i feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience i find it to be completely fascinatingright from the opening credits with lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress you will know that you are in for a visual treat every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her patients they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight the costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour the camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same the characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature if you dont enjoy anything else about the cell you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenesthe casting is top notch also jennifer lopez is in her element here utilizing her natural compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings makeup and costumes she is incredibly sexy and i personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the romcom world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further vince vaughn is fairly convincing as an fbi agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman but it is without a doubt vincent donofrio that has the biggest impression here its an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer we are disgusted at his actions yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life he looks magnificently powerful within his realm yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world its a great performance from an underrated actorwhile the cell doesnt work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts some of the actions of the characters are not believable and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic it is an occasionally shocking visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings,1,1,positive,
this movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of the chronicles of narnia shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays ever written it is well executed acted and directed the cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but im sure it was intended to be so the screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie through out the movie i found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen this is a wonderful piece of cinema and i can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews fair warning though this was a 6 tissue movie for me very touching very heartfelt performances,1,1,positive,

the psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out its often billed as an antirpg movie but its really not that simple here are come apparent contradictions that make me wonder just what if anything theyre trying to say about gamingthey laboriously introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction all of them having parents who are divorced alcoholic and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times theyre harshly pressuring them to succeed tom hanks is arguably the worst off having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives and sure enough at the end when they go to see robbie hanks theyre all happy and welladjusted embarking on their adult careers problems solved games put away daniel doesnt even want to design computer games any more and even robbies mother whos been constantly drunk and dissatisfied is suddenly the happy homemaker looking fresh and bright and arranging flowers sure jj suddenly and quite cheerfully it seems decides to commit suicide but the reason seems to be entirely because hes a lonely boy genius who cant get a date and not because his character dies as in the famous jack chick tract which happens afterward anyways and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end daniels game and get everyone to come play his in fact the prospect of liveaction role playing in the caverns seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself and in what may be the coolest tableau scene in the whole movie kate looking very fetching in chain mail looks right at the camera and says something like the scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds the biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty homelesslooking guy of his magic beans the recurring theme a the way we were for the 80smight have been poignant at the end but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place and for one final mystery our hero wearing full pardu regalia has a psychotic break becomes his character completely and embarks on his quest so of course the first thing he does is change into 20century street clothes so maybe the movies irrational but i guess its dealing with an irrational topic in those days a circle of kids with dice and pencils was regarded as tainted and possibly possessed and you could go insane if they spoke their mumbojumbo at you the antigame paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene where the reporter asks the cop whats going on the cop says a kids lost in the tunnels and theres a chance mazes and monsters is somehow involved the reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game although he allows his own children to play it then turns to the camera and reels off a polished spiel that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation in the end its no masterpiece but interesting as madefortv movies go,0,0,negative,
the words swedish and action movie do not mix that becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre this is yet another failed attemptlasse brunell shanti roney works at a military air base with top secret computer systems one day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he doesnt do what they tell him they want the secret equipment and will do anything to get itthis movie has its ups and downs and usually in swedish action movies there are no ups just downs so i guess something in this movie showed some quality to begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made the footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice the acting is of very varying quality shanti roney makes a decent performance while maria bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual i wonder how long swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank stefan sauk is laughable as the cool special forces man who comes to the base to investigateand what about the action scenes well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice but aside from that there is not much action to talk about and that is a common problem with swedish action films there is just not enough action going on maybe its a budget problem maybe its filmmaking culture i dont know but it negatively affects the experience because quite frankly the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on thati rate this 410 for effort,0,-1,neutral,

the only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is not because i havent seen every film released in 2001 thus far its because this film was only made partly in 2001 the rest of it was stolen from roger cormans other dinosaur films carnosaur 13i have a confession to make carnosaur 2 is perhaps one of my favorite bmovies it borrows so much from james camerons aliens its not even funny but i love it i cant explain exactly why it just works for me i liked the sets i liked the cinematography i liked how they borrowed from aliens its all a bit ironic that cameron at one point was an understudy of cormans with films like battle beyond the stars 1980i own the carnosaur trilogy on dvd and the most i can say for part one is that it has moments the most i can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it watchablenow we have raptor which does not continue that series instead it borrows entire scenes from the carnosaur trilogy and builds a movie around it and somehow roger corman was able to get eric roberts and corbin bernsen to do it now im not saying either roberts or bernsen are at any kind of career high but they were both at one point what could be called respectable actors not here sure actors react to effects they wont even see while filming all the time here however they are reacting to mismatched footage from films that are between five and eight years old theres even a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character in carnosaur 1 apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy backwhen raptor was announced i was a wee bit excited i was however disappointed when corman said that theyd be using the old dinosaur models from carnosaur apparently corman decided after this interview was conducted that he wouldnt even do that and its not that he couldnt find an fx crew to do it the script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story had to be built around preexisting stock footagedont compare this to ed wood ed did better than this at least he only used the stock footage of bela once in one film there are ways of incorporating stock footage into a movie and raptor takes this frownedupon technique to a new low even if you liked carnosaur 3 primal species stay away from raptor,0,-1,positive,
in the year 1985 my birth year steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young africanamerican girl celie debut role for whoopi goldberg whose life is followed through rough times the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old she has given birth two children for her father celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling women are inferior of men and especially being an africanamerican woman their rights are less than a zero celies story is a true survival storythe color purple is a masterpiece and underestimated film of spielberg he should make more drama which the color purple and schindlers list are good notionthe cast is amazing whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama danny glover was surprisingly nasty mister i have never seen him in a such an evil role the talkshow icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strongwilled sofiawarning prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sisterbig applauds to mr spielberg,1,1,positive,
dont know if this contains any spoilers or not but i dont want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462i disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described guns germs and steel as politically correct and neomarxist they cannot have watched the same series that i didthe series i watched depicted the history of european colonisation in the americas and southern africa with no particular inaccuracies i saw nothing in the series that portrayed europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky though europeans often were lucky and theres nothing wrong with luck neither did i see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things if anything the inca was rather arrogant as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power i certainly saw nothing that could be construed as marxist or neomarxist except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginationsotherwise many african peoples do have a builtin immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that europeans lack at the time they were at the height of their successes the aztec maya and inca civilisations were as advanced as any other in the world and as wealthy sometimes more so aboriginal american and khoisan populations were decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by europeans just as european colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria note the khoisan peoples are completely different from all other subsaharan african peoples so i dont see what some of the other commentators are complaining about the only thing i can find to complain about is that the series doesnt tell me anything i did not know by the time i finished seventh grade theres really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film it does however present some nice dramatisations of events such as the conquest of the incas the production values are very high and it fills in a few holes here and there that didnt get covered in mrs grubers sixth hour social studies class at milan middle schoolif you rent or buy this assuming you had a decent primary andor secondary school education you wont learn anything new but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reviewing what you already learned or should have learned by the time you hit high school,1,0,negative,
it seems that salvatores couldnt decide what to do with this movie some of it is a very weak thriller and i say very very weak some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters both things have been tried in psychological thrillers but in this case the movie cannot hold things together due to poor superficial scripting bad acting and a too dark too dull cinematography id say that salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot on the whole a bmovie hardly worth your money vote 410,0,0,positive,

its a refreshing breath of air when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning a middle and a end a nice clever mystery with an appealing heroine for all ages who wins us over with her wit and charm andrew flemings film is indeed a modern marvel a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in hollywood he puts away the overreliance on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film with a very capable young actress and a talented supporting castthe film is based on the old books but it has been given updated enough to put in this century however the props might be different the heart still is a good mystery and there is clever one here one that ties the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth emma roberts is an old fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others details that are sorely missing from todays films she is still good enough to get boys attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect she earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little guile when it is needed to achieve her goalswhile taking a vacation to california our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play suddenly she is visited by her ghost and this sets off a series of events that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself what makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details as she discovers that her customary world is nothing compared to the california scene and this is well presented without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual eventually the director has enough control to make it all very palatable to all types of audiences from the young ones to the adults in the audience it is a movie that deserves to be seen appreciated and enjoyed a film that is rare and delicate and its not afraid to be classified as fun five stars,1,-1,positive,

john knowles modern masterpiece a separate peace are one of many subtle and subtly is the watch word themes of love hate jealously denial and regret the 1972 version does attempt to address this style and what the book is a love story with war looming in the background the 2004 version does not use subtly at all but overtness in the portrayal of the story what is staring you in the face when you read the novel is a love story and yes maybe it is arguable a gay love story in the novel and 1972 film version there are sexual undertones everywhere in the writings and dialogin the 2004 showtime film version these tensions were omitted and the actors were in there late twenties playing teenagers which caused for mature acting taking away from any tenderness or hesitation of innocence in youthi did not like this remake for more reasons the hair that broke the camels back was that phineas was given a surname on the letters he received from the draft boards finny is a character that does not have nor needs a last name john knowles did that intentionallythough i accept the 1972 version the acting was at times a little amateurish so what it attempted to be sincere to the novel by shooting on location at phillips exeter academy that the devon acedemy was based on which also the writer john knowles attended as a studentthe directors and producers took all teenage exeter students with exception of parker stevenson whom attended the brooks school to play in a paramount film class act by preppies compared to this canadian college shot played with adult actors politically correct platonic version no veto on this sham try again the 1972 film version with john heyl and parker stevenson was the real deal for a separate peace on the screen the showtime 2004 film made for cable version was not,0,-1,positive,

okay i was bored and decided to see this movie but i think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage then basically that same hour repeated 4 times it consists of 1 gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan 2 flashbacks to the mens wives 3 the approach of the troops marching in a long line 4 men running up hill and shooting usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him 5 defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6 men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs that was the basic movie and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times and every time it did a flashback to the wives it would show the man then his wife and him there were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time other than that the men couldnt kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades i liked the music and there was a lot of action though the action was repetitive overall i probably wouldnt see it again but it wasnt too horrible,0,0,negative,

the main premise for this movie is every womans fantasy a vagina that kills and eats men well at least it is a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight against a man whats that 999999 of women but dont worry its not a gory kind of eating of men its more like a comical slurping them in like a drain plug theres no blood or parts left behind so for blood guts gore fans forget about this film not much gore herethe two main characters of the film are somewhat unrealistic helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute meanwhile dennis is a nice guy who stalks helenthe story is already a little silly at this point but then they throw in two more equally silly substories that just send this movie into the bad bmovie territory the first new substory is about dennis finding new love with a pair of conjoined twins and then eventually murdering one of them and becoming a fugitive bankrobber the second new substory is about helen finding new love with a nice policeman who rescued her from a prostitutionrelated bad date and decided he wanted to marry her dennis and helen eventually meet up again at the end of movie in totally unbelievable circumstances and magically helens murderous vagina is cured,0,0,positive,

the lion king series is easily the crowning achievement in disney animation the original lion king is the greatest masterpiece in cel animation lion king iisimbas pride is the by far the best directtovideo sequel that disney or any other studio has made for an animated feature it deserved a theatrical release the same can be said for this movie it has the original cast songs by elton john a hilarious story exciting action and touching character moments everything youve come to expect from this series not so much a new story but filler and extended background on timon and pumbaa and their place in this story what impressed me the most was the care taken in the animation all to often disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts but here they seamlessly blend new animation with footage from the original film the scenes never seem out of place nathan lane and ernie sabella are in full swing as timon and pumbaa matthew broderick robert guillame and moira kelly reprise their roles as simba rafiki and nala respectively we even get a return visit by whoopi goldberg and cheech marin as the hyenasthere are many big laughs in this movie so if you love lion king you need this movie the story is just not complete without it,1,1,positive,

terrible movie just terrible the start of this movie is like something out of a bad women in prison movie then it moves on to being a bmovie version of aliens bmovie in this case meaning the addition of gratuitous sexscenes and women in lingerie oh and a lot of the footage is the exact same as used in two other movies by the same company including the women in prison schtick the only thing saving this movie from a 110 is that i have actually seen worse movies not many and not much but worse,0,0,negative,

james j corbetts autobiography the roar of the crowd was the starting point of this lively and wellremembered fictionalized biography the author was heavyweight champion of the world succeeding john l sullivan before the turn of the century the events of the narrative depict corbett as a brash but likable and intelligent young man whose conquest of the world of boxing and social prejudice in his time when he was considered merely the son of irish immigrants a lowly bank teller and a nobody surprised everyone it took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screentime to prove his compeers were wrong he is an bank teller when the film opens but he somehow wangles an invitation to a sporting club for the welltodo he falls in love with a beautiful but snobbish girl with whom he always seems to be quarreling and he lives at home with a brawling clan of corbetts who seem to fight with one another as often as with others when he defeats the clubs best and a professional fighter borough in to embarrass him he finally decides to become famous by fighting he sets out on the road with his friend who acts as manager and trainer and despite a few near setbacks he wins all his bouts and attracts attention coming home to pursue his girl again he contrives to annoy the boston strongboy mighty john l sullivan who enters bars and claims he can lick any man in the world few believe he can win a bout against sullivan but corbett dubbed gentleman jim for his gracious manners and patrician appearance surprises everyone by moving dancing out of range and negating the furious sullivans power the films finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten sullivan comes to congratulate corbett the new champion rises to the moment tells sullivan a few years before it might have been different and shows him nothing but admiration and respect he gets his girl as a result of his two performances but by the end of the film as they visit his s parents his manager is able to tell the world the corbetts are at it again the films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy the script was written by veteran horace mccoy and vincent lawrence from the corbett novel sidney hickox did the cinematography with period set decorations by clarence steensen and art direction by ted smith heinz roemheld did the music and milo anderson the gowns the film was ably directed by actionfilm specialist raoul walsh flynn also liked working with walsh but did not care for the other director he worked for most often michael curtiz among the castwere ward bond as john l sullivan in one of his best performances lovely alexis smith a bit spotty but intelligent as the girl corbett loves and a very able errol flynn as corbett a young man he seemed to relish playinghe later said it was his favorite role from the periodjack carson was his manager alan hale his charismatic father john loder a rich foe with william frawley minor watson madeleine lebeau rhys williams arthur shields dorothy vaughn and mike mazurki along for the enjoyable proceedings it is hard to say enough about the logic and lighthearted fun this movies makers have generated it is one of the bestliked of all sports biography films and by my standards one of the most enjoyable as well,1,-1,positive,
considered by many to be a strangely overlooked chabrol it seems to me the reason it has been cold shouldered is its sleaze factor not as overtly sexy violent or gory as many films of this period it nevertheless starts rather startlingly and although becoming more measured continues to ooze a rather unpleasant odour ms audran not here the ice maiden but a drunken mother donald pleasence does a cameo as a child molester david hemmings has his eyes on underage sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother sister and niece no not very nice at all and chabrol treats it all as if it is very normal like it might be in some small french village instead of ed mcbains new york city had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film here we really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant options before the final denouement very watchable,1,-1,neutral,
when i heard about hammerhead being released on dvd and finally found it at my local dvd store i thought well just another cheap monster movie from nu image those guys around boaz davidson and avi lerner produced cheap but very entertaining b pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies so i didnt expect much especially after having watched the rather disappointing shark zone just a few days before but hammerhead turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movies we have a mad scientist a group of people in a dangerous situation screaming women and damsels in distress maneating plants and of course we have the creature a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark everything you need for an entertaining monster movie the only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind but since the movie was made for tv its understandable why these scenes are missing and it doesnt matter anyway cause hammerhead is action and horror entertainment at its best there are two reasons why i gave it seven out of ten points though first of all the monster isnt seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done and secondly william forsythe just isnt the right guy for the hero part and for falling in love with gorgeous hunter tylo other than that i can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn watch this movie and have fun jasper p morgan,1,0,positive,
filmed by mgm on the same sets as the english version but in german garbos second portrayal of anna christie benefited from practice and her apparent ease with german dialog garbo appears more relaxed and natural under jacques feyders direction than under clarence browns and her silent movie mannerisms have all but disappeared which made her transition to sound complete the strength she brought to the character remains here although it has been softened and garbo reveals more of annas vulnerability the entire cast with the exception of garbo is different from the previous version of the film and garbo benefits from not having to compete with marie dressler who stole every scene she was in during the englishlanguage version in feyders film garbo holds the center of attention throughout although the three supporting players particularly the father gave excellent performancesfeyders direction was more assured than clarence browns and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as constrained by the new sound process as did those of brown the film moves with more fluidity than the english language adaptation and the static nature of the first film has been replaced with a flow that maintains viewer interest even william daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the brown version he captured garbos luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style also the screenplay adaptation for the european audience made annas profession quite clear from the start and the explicitness clarifies for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the brown filming however the film was made before the production code was introduced which made the censorship puzzlinggarbos oscar nomination for anna christie was always somewhat mystifying and i suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance however some of the academy voters may have seen the germanlanguage version of the film and they realized as will contemporary viewers that her anna christie under feyders direction was definitely oscar worthy,1,1,positive,
i recently saw house of wax and must say i really enjoyed itits been one of the better horrorthriller films in the past few years if not one of the best and most entertainingive heard a lot of people bashing the socalled slow start and character development which takes up the films opening 45 minutesyet if the film dived straight into the deaths audiences and critics would have criticised the film for not having decent characters who they couldnt care less aboutwell as for the character development i think it worked amazingly welltaking into my own response and others from reading posts off the message board a lot of people ended up wanting the characters to live one of which ive noticed many people mentioning being paige edwards paris hilton taking into consideration warner bros have been marketing her death its a surprise turn around that many audiences ended up cheering her on for survivalspeaking of the chasedeath scenes they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful ive witnessed in a while and enjoyed each one very muchthe acting in the film was absolutely fine i couldnt fault any of them especially paris hilton i thought she was very decent and i was hoping for her the get more than a mere 25 minutes screen time in a 120 minute film yet her chase scene made up for that and believe me when i say paris can act scared watch the scene where shes hiding in a car from vincent and he walks past her the look of terror on her face comes across as very realoverall i give house of wax maximum stars for entertainment value and suspense and even gore only criticism is i wish that during the marketing for the film they hadnt revealed the death list and who dies and who survives as it would have been ten times better not knowing if the character being chased was going to live or die and horrible deathcant wait for the dvd but go see it at the cinema while you can it wont be the same in your own front room yet if you do wait for the dvd watch the film in the dark with no interruptions trust me you wont be disappointed,1,-1,positive,

why a stupid boring crappy overrated film series like star wars gets all the hype and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely unnoticed is beyond me this movie will really open your eyes to the dark disturbing sad and scary world we live inunlike the boring elephant this movie isnt one of those just a typical day until someome pulls the trigger movies this movie focuses more on what happens after the eventdeana played by the very hot and very talented erika christensen is a happy and healthy straighta student with great friends and a great life until she is injured on the day of the shooting by being shot in the head luckily she is not killed but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain in addition to the physicalmeanwhile alicia played by the also very gorgeous and talented busy phillips is a nasty coldhearted rebellious antisocial goth girl who doesnt have a single positive trait on her and she is unharmed when the shooting happens because it turns out she was friends with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions when she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something and she still doesnt so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students and after she walks out on that the principal decides enough is enough and forces her to go visit deana in the hospital of course she refuses this too but the principal says that if alicia doesnt do this the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something and so she actually goes to see herthe lonely traumatized and both physically and emotionally wounded deana is more than happy to have someone visit her but of course alicia is anything but happy to be seeing her deana attempts to give her a friendly welcome but of course alicia responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced and has no intention of being friendly with her at all but sooner or later that intention will change and thats all ill say this is truly one of the most moving movies ever as well as one of the most dark and disturbing actually i think i would tie this with american history x as equally disturbing and moving at the same timewarning watch this movie at your own risk it contains very graphic scenes and images excellent and criminally underappreciated movie i feel so ashamed that im pretty much the only one that knows about it,1,1,positive,

russian actress tatiana samoilova reminds me so much of the young audrey hepburn and the camera in the cranes are flying seems to love her just as much she is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of world war ii in moscowthe film is almost poetic in its gorgeous bw cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place since i had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on tcmits a very moving love story about a girls deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime russia shes unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from their marriage is a troubled one because she cant let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheartby the end of the story she accepts the idea that hes never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation theres a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous familiesthe stylish and striking camerawork is what carries the film as well as the honestly played storytastefully done but perhaps the english subtitles didnt tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed oversumming up easy to see why it won awards at the cannes film festival reminded me in style of another great russian film ballad of a soldier,1,1,positive,

a terrific bfeature a virtual twohander and set over the course of a day you can see its stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play and although only 77 minutes long played out in sequences akin to something like real time robert ryan is the psychopath who keeps ida lupino trapped in her own home both are superb especially the underrated lupino whose initial independence and selfcontrol soon crumble before ryans unhinged intruder today of course it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director harry horner much better known as an art director only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of hitchcock,1,1,neutral,
as a spiritualist and non christian i thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith but what a load of i seers i thought the film would have great arguments but only got one sided views from atheists and jews and who are all these street people hes interviewing who dont know the back of their arm from their head where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970 personally this dvd was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an antichrist told me so please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding god because his own ego and demons got the better of him no im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves but if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in jesus then entice us with your worth not your beating off the drums,0,-1,positive,

what a great show a very underrated dramatic show it is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other characters are the main charactersi think the best character on the show is vern schillinger he is a tough bad guy and an aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be this show has many murders i think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show but i have to admit that is one of the reasons why i think the show is so greati think some characters were killed off a little early but some sure still made their mark you cant compare things like prison break to this show they are totally different i think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them a great show my favorites a show that should be considered of the the greats for years to come,1,-1,positive,
i really wanted to like this film and i dont think i was terribly disappointed being an american history teacher i felt an obligation almost to see this film and as far as the history went it wasnt bad sure there were a few mistakes here and there especially with the timelinethe movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a yearnot over six years of actual fighting but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent unfortunately the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich loyalist for the most part it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed tacked onlike a plot device instead of a real honesttogoodness romance in fact as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb clich of love at fist sight it was kind of annoying the more i think about ithowever in spite of this romance the film is truly interesting and inspiringplus in so many ways it seems as if the much later film the patriot was copied from this griffith film both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the british and using horrible and evil tactics against the civiliansand both having the secret intention of using this as a springboard to starting their own nation in the america the only major difference is that this film is set in the north and the patriot was in the carolinas it sure would have been nice if mel gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to d w griffith for the story ideas it just doesnt seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each otherpsdespite me liking this film and some other of griffiths films he does deserve to once again burn in hell for his having white actors portray all the black servants in the film this is a sick and bigoted thing that griffith did in so many of his filmsespecially in birth of a nation i gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays blacks that he was aok with slavery and was quite the apologist for this quaint institution dont get mad at methis is meant as sarcasm,1,0,positive,

dont get me wrong i love the tv series of league of gentlemen it was funny twisted and completely inspired i was looking forward to the movie the premise was interesting and i looked forward to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take themit was a total disappointment for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters why not pick mickey pauline papa lazaro or tubs and edward for the main parts it was unfunny throughout half baked gags and poor slapstick humourthe real clincher was the plain ridiculous period drama comedy and i will use the word comedy loosely it distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward not to mention painfully unfunny the direction of the movie is appalling and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take very rushedthen the three headed plasticineesquire monster what the hell was all that about plain ridiculous it felt like the league of gentlemen tagged it on at the endall in all i found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film what was once an amazing television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film if i could give it 0 out of 10 i would do not waste your money seeing this,0,-1,positive,

where do i begin its one of the most frustrating movies ive seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid a movie about a ghost inhabited bed the first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a fabienne from pulp fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the way to do it fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so far everythings normal then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress they realize they need a bed frame this is where things get fishy why didnt they bring or buy a gd damn bed frame before they got there we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesnt open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the door magically opens they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are savedor so they thought the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if theyre bring tortured or tied upone of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge while packing up the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on herwell if youve read this far you have to be thinking one thingwhy the hell didnt they just throw the bedframe out the window seriously they never said anything about the actual house being haunted just the bedso why not get rid of the damn thing and move on thats why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than sonny corleone at a toll booth the couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going so props to that still though me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minuteswhy didnt they just throw the bed out especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or somethingall in all its a nearwatchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot to an extent but the solution is so simple youre scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be the highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he cant shoot her like that4 out of 10 a low budget porno the man show would love,0,-1,positive,

in this tale of a tightly wound christian family that has three of its four members born again after a cakecaused car crash what really stands out is how grounded most of it is where there is so much potential to go over the top and how truly inspired most of the acting is where most of the films moments particularly its frank and innocent discussions of sexuality after three of the four family members have their guilt and shame removed is hilarious it is also thoughtprovoking and the characters stay with youhow often for example does a character in a comedy spin from near caricature to fullbodied emotional being in the course of one scene how often do we see a cast that can pull back from showboating midsentence in order to show a bit of the humanity beneath the characters skin even many of the bad guys in this film have moments of heartbreaking honesty even while much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrifying there is truth and history behind even the most questionable acts in this film which is a difficult task in satirehow refreshing it is to see a darkish comedy that can dare to be humanistic how nice to see actors so fully committed to character that they can dare to let them be ridiculous and sublimeand as a gay person i do not think i have ever been quite so touched by a heterosexual sex scene as i was by the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accidentbravo bravo one of my favorites at outfest this year,1,0,negative,

well now this strange movie it was listed as a comedy but i certainly found nothing to laugh at actually i am struggling to find anything positive to say about this film oh here i go alex ferns is not bad in the lead role and i did not pick the ending for a change but apart from that this has no great direction solidly two dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama i would really avoid ever having to watch this movie again and think it does nothing to benefit any of the working class characters it is attempting to portray i found it hard to empathise for any of the characters and was not given enough information on the lead character jimmy to believe his motives best avoided,0,-1,positive,
life was going great for new york city advertising artist ted kramer he had a great job and a loving wife no actually his wife wasnt so loving for when ted returned home late from work that night his wife joanna had a suit case packed and was heading out the door he tried to stop her but she just got into the elevator and out of teds life well now in addition to his job hes now got to mind the house as well as their 6yearold son billy ted assured his boss that his wifes leaving would not affect his job performance in any way it did however affect his performance as a father he blew up when billy spilled punch on his client artwork well some time later ted and billy receive a letter from joanna and it was obvious from her letter that she wasnt coming back ted was distraught well he was late coming home from work on billys birthday which made billy sore at him ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting when he got home he yelled at billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner then later he truthfully told billy that the breakup between he and joanna may have been his fault not billys ted invited a good friend phyllis bernard over that night and well billy got his first look at a naked woman when ted took billy to the park the following day he fell off the jungle gym and landed facefirst onto his toy plane ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches after that life began taking a downward spiral for ted then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than joanna they met in a corner caf at first they have a pleasant conversation but then joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her ted would have none of it and stormed out well life got even worse for ted when his boss jim oconnor took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him not only that but joanna was choosing to sue for custody of billy and without a job ted didnt stand a chance in hell for winning he hired himself a lawyer john shaunessy who charged a pretty penny 15000 exact change and thats if they win ted was also able to find a new job it was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination finally the court date january 9 1980 arrived judge atkins presiding joanna took the stand and shaunessy proceeded to question her about why she left ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures the next day ted took the stand and joannas lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger teds good friend margaret took the stand as well and she really didnt help matters well the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough one day shaunessy informs ted that he lost joanna got sole custody of billy how typical always ruling in favor of the mother well ted and billy were just devastated about parting ways they had a tearful goodbye when suddenly joanna stopped by she and ted have a little talk and well rather than just give away the ending let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybodythis was a very good movie dustin hoffman was very good he earned that academy award ive also seen him in hook meet the fockers and rain man which he also won an oscar for meryl streep was good she also got an oscar justin henry was good too so where was his nomination i guess the academy had a rule against giving oscars to children but the rule was lifted when haley joel osment came along this movie has great drama light comedy and is very subtle it does a good job of holding your attention i was watching rain man on tcm the other night then this came on after and i just couldnt help but watch and thats what you should do if you like dustin hoffman or meryl streep or movies of this genre then i recommend kramer vs kramer a gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child i liked teds little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time what was it about sex that makes a good parents actually thats how they have the child but seriously hes right why always rule in favor of the mother because shes a woman also in the cast george coe howard duff who passed away in 1990 and howland chamberlain who passed away in 1984 watch for an upandcoming jobeth williams in the nudity in the hallway scene anyway see kramer vs kramer today good movie,1,1,positive,

footprints certainly isnt your average run of the mill giallo and thats no bad thing unlike his previous effort the fifth cord which was your classic giallo luigi bazzonis film forsakes almost all of the giallo trademarks and instead of murder the focus is very on psychological mystery its obvious from the outset that this is going to be an entirely bizarre film as the film opens up with a scene set on the moon things dont get any clearer after that as the lunar sequence turns out to be the dream of alice a troubled woman alice is tormented by dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon which have apparently come from a viewing of a film called footprints on the moon after several things go wrong for her alice decides to go to a mostly deserted former tourist spot named garma upon her arrival she is surprised as the people she meets seem to already know her alice also meets a young red headed girl who also seems to already know her the girl tells alice she looks exactly like nicole except nicer and with shorter hairthe fact that footprints doesnt feature much in the way of sex murder and other giallo trademarks puts it somewhat on the back foot with its primary audience from the beginning as most people going into this film arent going to get what they were expecting or probably wanted but on the other hand footprints commands respect for the fact that it doesnt just follow on from what went before it by 1975 the giallo had started to lose its popularity and many of the films coming out around this period with a few very notable exceptions were merely retreads of what came before so luigi bazzoni would have been taking a big chance on this film florinda bolkan gives a strong performance in the lead role and the fact that shes not the prettiest giallo heroine isnt really important the mystery builds nicely throughout and while it can become a little turgid at times footprints is generally speaking intriguing for the duration it probably wont come as a surprise to many once they get there that the ending doesnt make much sense and doesnt really clear anything up but it nicely adds to the bizarre cult value of the film and all in all i give footprints a thumbs up,1,0,negative,
yes this movie was just bad in every way in things like casteffectsboredomexcitementand of coursebeing fantastic and we all know the four heroes in this one were a bit more colourful compared to the new ones but it still has to goa fantastic bore like this really was just silly trash which i knew nobody would like when i saw iti mean surely with that budget about 3 or 4 good movies could have been made but no i am just glad that the new version made this year totally showed everyone how the fantastic four should have been made with good storygreat cast like jessica alba one of my favourite actresses otherwise it would have been totally forgotten but thankfully no the new one was excellent when i saw it with my mates at the cinema but this old fantastic bore has gotta go,0,1,positive,

the childs play series isnt a favourite of mine but bride of chucky is actually an okay movie this time we have two dolls chucky and his former girlfriend when he was human tiffany together they go on a journey to find an object there are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding the sex scene between chucky and tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place wasnt really a straight forward horror it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre this made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies all up even if your not a childs play fan give this one a go,1,-1,neutral,
ive seen thousands of movies and have never written a review but the red eye i witnessed is so at odds with the glowing tributes posted here that im compelled to offer my two cents in protest and vote the lowest score possible just to bring the average closer to reality this is a dull boring stinker of a film that is memorable only for its apologist depictions of the terrorists target a john boltonesquire bully diplomat whos really a great guy dont you know and of the ohsohandsome and popular dr phil whose bestselling book one learns is read by frequent fliers worldwide the only real red eye i experienced was from rubbing my eyes in disbeliefbefore you fork out 10 or so dollars for this b movie read the selected quotes from trailer above and ask yourself if youll really enjoy a movie in which these were the cleverest lines to be found unfortunately nothing else in this film is any better the basic premise is goofy as hell the acting is bland and uninspired completely lacking in proantagonist chemistry the potential for suspense is thwarted at every turn except during the last five minutes by poor directing and anticipatory editing the script is riddled with incongruities like early reveals of the heroine as a university lacrosse star are called into question when she later battles the antagonist with a field hockey stick and the plot holes are wider than first class while character development is strictly coachand then there are the moments of extreme ridiculousness like when the daughter of a high level public servant does not head straight for airport security at her first opportunity to warn them of an assassination plot against the both the head of homeland security and her father or when that same woman runs hellbentforleather along slick airport linoleum arms pistoning and veins in her neck bulging while wearing 4 inch stiletto heels or when her pursuer chases likewise with a sucking wound in his trachea or when terrorists use a fishing pole to bring up their weapon from the freaking harbor bottom im always willing to suspend disbelief but im not going to leap from 3000 feet without a parachutethe one good thing i can say of this movie is that it portrays women who are capable even in bimbo form of handling the most extreme emergencies the kind of gender imaging sorely lacking in american movies other than that this movie never really takes off and is no more thrilling than the red eye flight from boston to ny remember the last time you got suckered by deceptive trailers and glowing tributes in this forum or elsewhere this is one of those times wait for the red eye video and dont watch it then either,0,0,positive,
this is probably the best television show ive ever seen i first saw it on comedy central several years ago at the time i was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order and having just watched all three series in order and unedited thank you internet and your wondrous series of tubes i am so glad i rediscovered it i think comedy central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a seasonand i tried to get friends and family to watch it but nobody really seemed to like it i need new friends so on my own i made the best out of it that i could even when i felt like it was waning a bit i still felt compelled to continue watching years after when i discovered little britain i immediately recognized pauline from log as having influenced marjorie in fat fighters also i love the idea of writers who act the entire shownot new but done impeccably here lb has nothing on log no offense matt davidlove you this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius serial murder implied cannibalismyou name it and its probably found in this wonderful unique piece of tv art the location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of royston vaseyyoull never leave i think my favorite character would have to be tubbs but each character as portrayed has its own charm my least favorite was papa lazarous that was until he resurfaced in series three clever and wholly unexpected its best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as i said before becomes so compelling while repulsing that you really cant stop watching this is not for those with weak stomachs kids conservatives or grandma unless youve got one saucy granny i have always loved british tv particularly comedies from monty python to benny hill red dwarf to keeping up appearances absolutely fabulous and the british originals coupling and the office but not their us counterpartssorry this is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between whats funny and whats just sick and twisted nothing nothing on us tv has ever come close to this level of entertainment us broadcast tv is so sad and lame i can barely stand to watch any of it its kind of sad that even our cable channels dont have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem your loss comedy central thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the across the pond that redeem the entire medium every decade or so basic cable here in the us has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently crossing lines with more graphic sexual content drug use and adult language but they are still years away from just deciding to be adults about showing real life adult behavior instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up sheesh its like the same basic show format for the past 35 years dont even get me started on us sitcoms waste of time and lots of wasted moneydid you know that according to jim has been on the air for 10 years 10 years anyway watch this show get it on dvd do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well youve never seen anything like it there are three specials that i have not watched yetim saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits hell watch them even if i have to chain him up and paint him with excrement lines and lines and lines and lines note that series three departs from one and twothe greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters the laugh track is gone thank bloody hell the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of royston vasey dont be thrown by any of that as by the end the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two i think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable brilliant confident and absolutely demented you will want to rewatch it again and again its amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sightgag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors closeup facial expression if ever i were to meet any of the writerperformers id implore them not to recreate it or try to top itid just say can i help you at all then theyd probably slap me so id ask them to sign the slapmark 10 out of 10,1,1,positive,

asia argento has never done a film so far as i know and this includes ones directed by her own father dario where she fails to show all of her anatomy at some point sure enough in the most boring opening dialogue scene ever poor madsen has her coming into his office and right there reminding us that even though her hair is up she can still stick her fingers in her crotch at any given second which she does but in such a random what am i really seeing that kind of way the dvd box packaging makes this look like a femme fatale film so you keep waiting to see her turn into a sleek and minimalist killer no such luck shes verbose hung up on some aging has been and even worse has no credible skills in physical agility other than surprise taking off all the clothes when any scene allows it her accented english would be cool if only she didnt try to make it sound so affected and try to talk like a 12 year old how about this plot weakminded but simultaneously nymphomaniacal woman is suddenly driven to kill while she already has another affair on the go and is running some cheap drug deal huh what does anyone have motivation in this movie to do anything other than buy a hamster the screenplay seems to be oriented by letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over i was expecting to see the worst acting on this appear as a producer who dumped money in it just to have some screen time there is nothing going on sub the obvious flaws of asias character that at any point in the movie delivers what the dvd cover promises shes weak but she knows how to kill she flails a lot she flails naked she flails half dressed she even flails in a dead womans clothing she is very floppy and unmotivated in fact floppy would have been a great name for this movie and a shot of asia passed out looking angry on the cover would have been a better representation there are actually shots of her eating airplane food whats that about the ending makes 0 sense everyone is just annoyingly wishy washy in their intent and their execution of all objectives the wife of lester doesnt deliver any real vengeance taking someone to bad karoeke is life threatening but not really valid and lester just floats around without really making much proclaimation of anything totally misleading key art yeah we know asia lost the baby fat of her first born but really a whole movie trying to pretend like thats interesting enough to drive a film about a passiveaggressive chick is not worth your while see point of no return instead,0,0,positive,
you can read all kinds of references into the world of idiocracy a futuristic world populated by pampered selfindulgent morons spoonfed by the technology of a bygone era this idea has its precedent in hg wells the time machine and aldous huxleys brave new world amongst other satiresearly in the film a narrator explains the quick degradation of humanity over five hundred years but does not fill in the gaps of where all the futuristic technology came from in the meanwhile most of the criticism of this very fun and funny film seems to surround this omission and the resulting complaint that the world isnt realistic as if realism has ever been a necessary quality of satire is brazil realistic how about futurama or transmetropolitan hell how about gullivers travels i thought not idiocracy while maybe not as pointed as the best of the genre hits the same notes and generally does so successfullybesides i didnt find the futuristic technology to be a problem it is pretty easy to figure out that mike judge is satirizing the current trend toward automation and simple product interfaces so that even total idiots can use them as in brave new world the society in the film seems to have reached a point of automated selfsufficiency at some point in the past apparently created by the nowextinct smart people in order to placate an increasingly stupid populace leaving the remainder of humanity free to indulge all the worst most selfish impulses they can come up with and grow even stupider the film just happens to take place during the last gasp of humanity as everything begins to fall apart for good it may still be unrealistic but if so its a remarkably wellpresented brand of unrealismthe stupid people take up most of the screen time of course but theyre just the victims they dont know any better mike judge saves his real hate for the intelligent people in power who are dead by the time the film begins but who are very much alive right now in the 21st century people like scientists who chase hair growth and prolonged erections for no other reason than the possibility that theyll turn a profit on their snakeoil treatments people like politicians who let corporations simply purchase the fda and fcc people like media executives and their yuppie stooges who promote stupidity who enable the destruction of all culture morality and health to make a quick buckafter all who is really to blame the morlocks or the eloi the paris hiltons of the world or the brilliant executives and advertisers that put her on tv and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave her there this is all implicit in idiocracy though a line here a hint there witness the hilarious autodoctor which literally does all the work in the health care system its one of the few aspects of the movie thats not pounded into the ground by the unnecessary narrator its just there for the viewer to pick up or not but it is one of the most interesting themes in a movie thats much smarter than any other comedy of the yearpity that so many people will leave the film thinking its just an excuse to show rear ends farting and people being hit in the groin not that that stuff isnt funny too and maybe it is a little pandering but in idiocracy its just not as simple as it seems,1,-1,positive,

you would have thought given how much this overblown pile of rubbish must have cost that the budget could have stretched to a decent scriptwriter instead they seemed to have opted for a bog standard hollywood paint by numbers disaster movie plot and dialog the only clich they seem to have missed was the cute kid but every other one is there theres the sullen hero flung together by fate with both his ex wife and estranged father theres the doting dad and the rebellious teenagertheres the professor that everyone thought was wrong until it turned out he wasntplayed appallingly by the normally excellent tom courtney seemingly in the grip of some powerful drugs plus the comic duo wandering about in the deserted underground railwayi sat down to watch this full of anticipation the cast is as noted amazing yet within minutes it became clear how bad this was going to be stuff this useless should come with a warning something along the lines ofthis film may have been made in britain but was aimed at the american market it therefore contains tired clichs stock characters stilted dialogue and a plot so lame brained and simplistic that even george w bush could understand itavoid,0,1,positive,

i have now suffered through parts the clonus horrorto have the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horrorthe story was about a cloningcentral owned by the the man they grow clones for harvesting organs from the clones later on for the original humans in need of transplants one clone escapes the government gets angry and kills all involved but the story somehow leaks out anywayit is truly shameful how a movie with potential is destroyed by amateurs such as fiveson the only thing he genuinely succeeded in doing was to weave in the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect what makes a human a human and would it be ok to grow clones for organic harvesting sadly mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left town until the very end in where a pathetic attempt is made to sum it upbut what disturbed me the most was the introducing of new characters lacking actual relevance for the plot despite that fiveson feels the need to kill them off in a bad explosion which only sir coleman francis himself would be proud ofthe setting was interesting how fiveson thought that pulling out sheets of plastic and running water over them would make a believable river is beyond me but i guess if you were to compare the setting to coleman francis gray pasty oatmeal of a setting this film would winperhaps coleman has changed what bad movies are for me 310,0,0,negative,
jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didnt have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machinesbut then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that herded cattle and planted crops so what explains their lack of technological economic and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for successdiamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox brought to north america by black slaves were our biggest weapon well if 150 europeans can defeat 20000 native warriors and 400 nonmilitary south africans can defeat 10000 zulus without a single casualty in either case then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant with or without germs we were going to succeedhe says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north killing thousands of europeans while not affecting africans id like to know real numbers but he doesnt say then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they cant catch up with us so which is it jared did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories hes reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it its sad watch this obvious neomarxist contort reality to try to prove his point,0,-1,neutral,
for native mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis used too many non native speakers especially jamukha too many diversions from the actual history terrible terrible subtitle i wonder where and who did that subtitle it was both in english and thai i wonder how bad the subtitle was in thai if the english subtitle was soooo bad described the one of the greatest leaders life very uninteresting there are better films made by mongolian directors with very low budget from 1980s honestly im wondering if the film critics of academy award is that lenient or what only good thing was some good cgi in some fighting scenes only moderately not over the top cgi,0,0,positive,
this movie made me laugh so much it was a bloody joke to tell you the truth so unbelievable and the worst plot ever the acting as well was bad i dont how come so many popular bollywood actors and actresses took on to do this movie the script must have been somewhat of a joke the visual effects in this movie was excrutiatingly painful to watch i believe that a kindergarten kid could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of coming up with a plotthe plot has numerous attempts at copying major hollywood movies like the terminator but it fails miserably i laughed my head off seeing this movie a total disaster in indian cinema history,0,0,negative,
i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little im 22 years old and the ending still gets to me all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and im shocked honestly by this rating of 58 i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and funcharlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog carface but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that cant stop ticking or thats the end of his life again when he and his best friend itchy look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races charlie takes the girl annmarie and makes fake promises in order to get the money but he ends up learning that maybe he should put annmarie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeanceall dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film its not disney but this is an excellent family film to watch not to mention that its just so cute and touching i know its ridicules and some people call me crazy but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls how could they not theyre just so loving and i think im going to cry again but anyways i would just recommend this movie for anyone its a fun movie to watch710,1,1,positive,
living in the middle east in israel i was excited when i bought my ticket for syriana having seen the trailer and being a thrillerlover i expected to see first of all a fast moving breath catching movie which wisely dips in global policymaking and the relation between oil power and corruption from a fresh angle well i almost left the movie in the middle the pace was painfully slow almost all characters were stereotyped the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult but as steve rhodes wrote in his review in the end you dont care save your money save your time choose another movierobi chernitsky,0,-1,positive,
this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context it was meant to be a parody of teenhorrordevilworship movies and the 80s saw plenty of them i saw this movie when it first came out and instantly liked it being a big fan of kiss it was great to see gene in the movie and anything with ozzy as a metalhating preacher cant be all bad also fastway was already a favorite of mine so it was great to hear them on the soundtrackthe original vhs this was predvd cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a demon looking on it was a special order and the price for the vhs copy at the time circa 1987 was 90 i really wanted the movie but not at that ridiculous price the ozzygene cover was only created for the 5 rerelease the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie so they had better put em on the cover same thing with the original little shop of horrors jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main stari have a trick or treat web site and its surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to sammi currallinall it was just a good time rocknroll movie definitely not to be taken too seriously but just enjoyed,1,-1,positive,

this could be one of the worse movies ive ever seen i dont see how could this ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller its more like a lumbering drama the scary music is excellent but since there werent any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs the movie had so much potential they had beautiful cinematography sp and interesting characters but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different,0,1,positive,
first of all i was expecting caged heat to be along the same lines as ilsa the wicked warden boy was i wrong in no way is this film 70s exploitation chix in chains or women in prison sure the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison who wear street clothes btw quite comical but nothing happensthere arent strong rivalries no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape and no inmates make out there are 2 shower scenes that i suspect is just recycled footage but no fights breaks out no one is seduced here or anywhere for that matter aside from the lack of plot unconvincing unsympathetic and flat characters a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to free their fellow inmatespuhlease the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunsetas opposed to letting this mess continuei feel scammed,0,-1,neutral,
this lasted several years despite the late hour it was onlike a lot of 80s crime dramas it looked cold both physically and figuratively this isnt a bad thing though and the obviously low budget actually worked in its favor gritty during a time when slick was inallan royals wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edgethe only actors i remembered were scott nylands earthquake and tony rosato sctv the cast of barely knowns was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a star and yes thats a young clark johnson homicide in a recurring spoti hope a dvd release is in the future someone out there wanna get on that,1,0,negative,
as an indie filmmaker i try to at least make a decent film this piece of was beyond low budget it was shot on video and not 24p minidv at least the look and feel of this was just baaaad i met the director a few years ago at showbiz expo in la and he was talking about that book filmmaking for dummies that he was putting together i thought this little video was going to be something but i guess i was wrong he could have brought the value up a little by shooting 16mm film instead of that awful video the plot was stupid as well as the acting and all the fake green screen and sound and the whole nine yards i had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice damn i did buy joyride which was a hell of a movie maybe the director should read real motion picture books on filmmaking and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget flick maybe he should learn from the masters who made night of the living dead and the evil dead and chain saw massacre just to name a few of the all time low budget great hits this is one video that should have stayed dead i cannot call it a film because he did not use film,0,-1,positive,

gamera vs viras was made lazily and much of it suffers as a resultspace aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera so they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys the aliens then take control of gamera and get him to attack mankindfirst of all i must say that i really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between gamera and viras viras looks like a big squid with a beak he has no energy weopons and does not shoot any rays out but he can close the apendages on top of his head to make a sharp pointy weopon so overall this is not a bad monster for gamera to fight and is decent viras really injures gamera badly by stabbing his underside of his shell with his pointy head and i am surprised gamera was able to survive thisunfortunately gamera vs viras decided to use footage from previous gamera films to fill time for this film they re show the battles between gamera and barugon and gamera and gaos when the aliens look at gameras past battles however when they show gameras battles with gaos they show the battle between gamera and gaos in the city first then they show the final battle between the two after they show re used footage of the final battle between gamera and gaos they show the first battle between gamera and gaos talk about showing the battles in non chronological order they did not even need to show the first battle they should have just stopped after they showed the final battle between the twoanother issue is that they decide to re show footage of gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack tokyo so they show the scene from gamera vs barugon where he destroys the dam after the show scenes from gamera the invincible which is a huge issue for me mainly due to the fact that gamera the invincible was in black and white using stock footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and that is not a good thingalso the dubbing is bad once again the two little kids are not that annoying but it would be nice to see a gamera film that did not involve little kidsso the over use of footage from other gamera films is a deterrant to this film the final fight is awesome so basically i recommend skipping to the final ten minutes and watching this film the rest is something that has already been seen before,0,0,positive,

the first five minutes of this movie showed potential after that it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy the best part is that i couldnt stop thinking of supertroopers thanks to joey kern i would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie there are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point the thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed 22 million in the box office and only cost about 15 million to make congrats to lions gate for being able to pull that one off,0,-1,positive,

this series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of dickens bleak house on film and perhaps someone will read the book contrary to what is probably received opinion diana rigg was poor as lady dedlock she was clunky and wooden lady d is a reserved character but not a martinet denholm elliot is wrong wrong wrong for mr jarndyce so ill interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying i didnt read the book so i dont have to take this guys opinion because hes basing his evaluations on the book true and not true for ex diana rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not youve read the book on the other hand denholm elliot is a passable jarndyce although too old the series fails not because its unfair to compare it to the book but because the various plot lines and characters just dont coalesce to make a coherent dramatic mysterious andcompelling entertainment it is dull and flat if you want to make apossibly good bleak house you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes but i suggest that producers etc leave dickens alone even a christmas carol television deadens the genius of dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters,0,0,negative,
although this film has had a lot of praise i personally found it boring there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable but the story of how they interrelate even if very unusual by our standards is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first as the tolerance of the various men is stretched we see their characters develop the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting it is a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland far from the city but hardly exciting enough to keep ones eyes open for,0,-1,positive,

i havent had a chance to view the previous film but from what ive read on other posts it was supposedly worse than this one although i doubt that is possible im a huge fan of the zombie genre and i am fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures that for all intents and purposes are human as an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head that said hotd 2 takes the zombie movie to an all new lowwithout giving any big spoilers which i really should do just so you wont bother wasting your time actually watching this movie i would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writers of this film portray our countries special forces gomer pile could have probably survived longer than the spec ops soldiers in this film for crying out loud they should have called them the special education forces instead if you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an outbreak of zombies at least have the soldiers be smarter than the walking corpses i understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team but you can find better ways to do it than having them set down their machine guns and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling crazy person rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basementthe writers actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more hightech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a vaccine for and the idea has merit if it wasnt stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of wayward film making i mean come on zombie films arent exactly high art and the viewer expects some tongueincheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrills but hotd 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the characters if you are a zombie movie fan like me please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one,0,-1,negative,

this film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow it accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads the steadiness of the camerawork avoiding rockvideo clichs that were actually invented for the beatles in their first two films tight editing and a nonjudgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god or demon yes there are minor holes in the plot and incidental details that are a little unnecessary and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics but the issue here as in the much more recent i walk the line or carpenters famed tv elvis biopic of the same era is whether the meaning of the performers life in its time and place as a catalyst for fans ideals and appreciation is made manifest in the performance and this is clearly the case here we come away from this movie understanding not only how buddy holly became a star but why i dont see what else one could want from the film,1,-1,neutral,
because it came from hbo and based on the imdb rating i watched the first season of this series what a waste the characters are occasionally interesting but mostly cartoonlike the acting ranges from good to mediocre talent with a s t r o n g emphasis on the latter not only prisoners also viewers should leave all hope at the cell door that this story is believable its such a load of dung that you will need unusually strong testicular fortitude to keep watching the violence as with most of the developments in the story is titillating and whatever morality is supposedly served up its of the lite variety if your idea of excellent television includes the the writing acting and overall production quality seen in the sopranos deadwood or six feet under avoid oz if you want to see a disneyland for illiterate jerks watch oz stuff like this gives edgy a bad name,0,-1,positive,
a great showfirst to the people who dont like itdont like it then dont watch itthis iswas an awesome show better than according to jim a favorite of mine it shows a real family household as opposed to 8 simple rulesetc where everything goes peachytheyre loud theyre messyi can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen it happens in real lifesorta like the portal to hell and everyone growling like dogs over the fastfood boxesits a been there showyou know whats coming but fun to watch because you have been there beforea good cast they work great together a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release mel gibsons safety videos were a highlight of the series as wellopinion good show really deserving of a dvd release deserving to not be canceled as well,1,1,positive,
i saw this film when it first came out and hated it i just saw it again 27 years later i actually liked some of it although robin williams was totally wrong for the role what i remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what i had understood when i read the book since i havent reread it i can only give you my impressions from the past but i am sure of one thing the film is a paean to family life whereas in the book almost all traditional institutions including and perhaps especially marriage are shown to be straitjackets that we would be well rid of the only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of childrensomething that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air too bad williams doesnt have a tenth of his charm my low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book as a film on its own it fares better but only for a few key performances mary beth hurt is wonderful i think anyone watching it would fall in love with her and john lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sexchange operation is fantastic he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity i watched him closely during all of his scenes and never once was he anything except womanly nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen and that made all the difference in fact of all the people in the film his is the only one which is irreproachable it is worth seeing this film only for his performance,0,1,positive,
i was willing to go with the original cruel intentions it went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories however this movie was in my opinion a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices i didnt honestly care what happened to any of them the strongest part of the original story les liasons not ci is the characters and their interactions not the events themselves i wasnt clear until i read the imdb that this movie was meant to be a prequel especially since the title includes a number 2 i expected a sequel but then determined that it must be a companion piece over all i must say that this movie read to me at least like a soft porn version of les liasons i was not impressed,0,-1,neutral,
i purchased this film on dvd for 4 but it was a waste the film is very bad the plot is your average monster film where it kills a few people the mayorchief doesnt believe it and they fight it at the endon the plus side the film quality is very good and the setting of new york is impressive for a budget film as opposed to a small coastal town the acting is reasonable toohowever the special effects mainstage in a monster film are laughable and the addition of a random bus load of kids to the plot half way through just gets weird the ending is just badin summary whenever you have a chance to see this dont there will be something better onrtc true horror films dont have a pg rating,0,0,negative,
this is one of those family movies that i cant imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9 a group of siblings discovers a sand fairy yes really conveniently located at the end of a notsosecret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle to which theyve been evacuated from the london blitz and there you have it all in one sentence the story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes fulfilled but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or instructive to children or vice versa the only reason i can think of for watching this is to see how starkly freddie highmores outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances,0,1,neutral,
well ill begin with this i love horrormovies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present second this is the worst movie of all times it even beats mean guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes and for that i pay it homagehowever the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided and you guys who rated this piece of cmoviecrap from 7 and up i know youre joking good one hahaha because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is you cant be for realeverything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up so ill leave it minor spoiler alertbut the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dogkennel for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me,0,0,positive,
a kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia extremely well done and polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing personally i could have done without the cross dressing element but i accept the nod to psycho and the fact that it had some logic bearing in mind the storyline nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end i cant help feel that there are more than a few of the directors own feelings of not being a real frenchman and jewish to boot still there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking isabelle adjani and good old shelly winters is as reliable as ever,1,-1,neutral,
um okay this is very poor indeed if compared to the first film the verymuchso critically acclaimed rosemarys baby in fact its a pretty poor film in general yes there are a few redeeming qualities but ill get to that laterwell it has been quite a while since the last film took place in fact its been pretty much eight years i believe rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and influence him in a good way rather than let him succumb to the evil future that the coven or tribe as it is referred to as here has laid out for him when she runs off with him and an empty bus comes and picks her up leaving her child with a hooker the hooker raises him until he comes of age where satan tries to possess him since he seems to be rejecting his evil heritage in every wayobviously things dont go as planned and then there is the ending that i would have felt seriously ashamed at had i not seen it coming since hearing that there was a sequel to rosemarys baby okay when i was around 11 years old i witnessed the masterpiece rosemarys baby and then read the book sequel thinking that this film was an adaptation of that i tracked this film down and got it was i right in doing so well in some way yes i am a true fan of this franchise and can say that i have seen the sequel and i have some idea as to what happens after the events in the first film speaking of both this film and son of rosemary ira levins own book sequel not yet adapted to filmruth gordon who played minnie in the first film is shown a few times in this film but whyohwhy is the coven so different the knife rosemary had dropped in the first film is shown sticking out of the ground yet minnie pulled it out the coven is now called the tribe as i said earlier they now go around in hooded capes chanting hail satan hail adrian hail satan hail adrian and so on and so forth the gothic building is now like a twostory house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere it looks like a little nice suburb home or something and the child itself is pretty normallooking with his eyes only going all catty when he gets mad and kills someone or something in that vainas far as the acting goes its pretty poor on all parts except for stephen mchattie whom plays a verygrown up adrian pattie duke astin replacing mia farrow as rosemary has to have one of the flatout worst performances ever to be caught on film it is so bad its almost not even funny when she screams oh my god and cries for like the fifteenth time in the movie youre just like okay its not funny anymore and then by the time she is gone and the movie has been on for twenty minutes only youre like thank the lord i dont have to hear her say oh my god any longer sheesh in the end this movie has very very very few redeeming qualities enough to get it at least four stars but if you look at it as a serious sequel to the first film its pretty much nonexistent,0,0,negative,
this tatty am dram adaptation scrambles soulessly through the plot of dickens wonderful book replacing the emotional impact with hurried transitions and any exterior locations with drawings its not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low of course but you have to question the point of making this in the first place when theres neither the time nor money to do it justice michael horderns scrooge is far too gentle at the outset making his transformation lack power and this isnt helped along by a lack of reaction from him as he watches the visions the other actors range from acceptable clive merrison paul copley to noncommittal bernard lee to seeming like theyre about to forget their lines john le mesurier it doesnt even score points for effort to be honest,0,1,positive,
all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid it is pretty boring and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff a couple exchanging nods over their good grub a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes sits down and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace quadrupletakes or more when people look at things solitary banjotuning and playing taking a break for a beer telling a joke to a fawn about a bigmouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies complete with many bigmouthed expressions which are needed for the weak punchline the sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread which to the squeamish become unpalatable when theres talk of people burned in a fire lots of seemingly stockfootage closeup shots of animals birds insects and spiders in the woodsthe movie starts with a forest fire then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe the killer evidently wasnt too satisfied by the axe he stole and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare handsif its true that the movie in the version available on the outofprint videotape is cut perhaps if theres a lot of footage that was cut it deserves another look on dvd otherwise its simply not very interesting and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoorsslasher fan,0,0,negative,

i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no ones heard of and could be a possible gem i saw this and since im a fan of violence and gore i got it it got the rating of em which means extremely mature thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else i got it the warning on the box said extreme violence extreme langauge and nudity the extreme violence struck my fancy the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick it had one or two gory scenes but ive seen worse in a pg13 movie of course the amount of gore in a movie isnt all that counts right you have plot also well the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it dont rent it i speak the truth i cant imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say im gonna rent that again it had its moments where it kept you going but im never going to see that film again,0,0,negative,

the highlight of this movie for me was without doubt tom hanks as mike sullivan he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional for him role hanks is usually the good guy in a movie the one you like admire and root for sullivan was definitely not a good guy its true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son even so he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings so hanks took a role i wouldnt have expected him in and he pulled it off wellhanks good performance aside though i certainly couldnt call this an enjoyable movie after an opening that i would best describe as enigmatic it wasnt entirely clear to me for a while where this was going it turns into a very sombre movie about the complicated relationships sullivan has developed as a gangster largely raised by rooney paul newman whos a sort of mob boss and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them clean so to speak isolated from his business after the older son witnesses a murder the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet gets the wrong son and the mother and leaves sullivan and his older son mike jr on the run it becomes a weird sort of fatherson bonding moviealthough it ends on a somewhat hopeful note at least in the overall context of the story its really very dark throughout that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall i have to confess that while i appreciated hanks performance the movie as a whole just didnt pull me in 410,0,-1,positive,

this is a very wellmade film meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife the plot is convincingly worked out and exciting the gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero its made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld charactersa couple of slight reservations i found the ending slightly onesided as it celebrates the heros successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point also i found the lead female character somewhat weak little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out,1,1,positive,
really average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see thisthe acting was average maybe a bit above average the camera usage was average actually below average the picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry the plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasnt put to good usethis couldve been so much more if it didnt go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgroundsall we see are flashbacks here and there of alice and how her home life is so bad her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter we see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her tell your mom to make some better food and everybody says its your mom yeah thats embarrassing but why would you run away from it i could definitely see if her mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it how immature were not even given a glimpse of what the couples lives have been like except that theyve been prostituting for awhile and the woman forgot her name gave her baby up when it was 9 months old this really couldve been so much more it couldve had alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie that is alice a girl with a home life of probably 90 of americas population working class runaways to florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitutei dont see why it won an award at sundance it mustve been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award also to me alices bostonnew england accent seemed forced it didnt seem genuine i should know i was born and raised in boston but now live in georgia 410 not really worth your time in my opinion,0,0,negative,
once upon a time theresa russell made a few halfway decent movies so i keep hoping that one of her efforts from the past decade or two will merit a rating of at least 6 or 7 out of 10 however dark world is just the latest in a string of disappointments the first 90 minutes are very hard to watch the lines are delivered by the lead actors as if they are being read at a first rehearsal or even a casting session in which the actors are doing it for the sake of their agents but do not really want the parts for which they are perfunctorily reading the sets and props seem off somehow what kind of a police department would allow a detective to have a whole living room wall shelved full of case file holders the screen is constantly cluttered with meaningless time and datelines which appear with no rhyme or reason now if the scriptwriter were standing here after the lights go up from a film fest screening they no doubt would crow about how all these shortcomings are really clever clues to the plot turning topsyturvy in this misfires final five minutes well for those audience members whose only other movie experiences are tv the movie and surfer dude they might be bamboozled into nodding their heads in agreement but it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in their lifeand is not a close friend or relative of a dark world cast or crew membercould fall for such a lame canard despite what the dvd box might lead you to believe this movie has about as much resemblance to sunset boulevard dead narrator device or hitchcock schizophrenic protagonist device as a drained jim beam bottle refilled with urine has to booze,0,-1,neutral,
for a film with so much promise it was disappointing thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievablethe plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and its the worst clichd ending ive seen in a movie for some time the final scene would have ripped my heart out if the entire movie hadnt been so painful to begin with i was numb from the very first scene one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting ive seen to date it was a horror in the true sense of the word,0,0,negative,
visitors is a hard hard movie to enjoy its so slow and leaden in its pacing that at times i was drifting off during the film this was about 11am on a hot sunny day i might add not midnight on a cold winter evening so you get an idea of just how slow this movie isstrange thing is its not long at 100 minutes its only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video and its only fifteen minutes longer than the superior darkwolf that id quite happily watched the day before it just drags an awful lot enough for you to lose interestwhen its not mistaking sloow development for atmosphere visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen while the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round out radha mitchells boatswoman the hauntingsalienswhatever are actually quite creepy and effective especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night full marks for not splurging makeup all over the shop too the single person boat is a creepy place and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of youstill though i find it hard to recommend visitors i came out of it not only feeling like id just watched a 4 hour film not a 100 minute one but also feeling like id been cheated somehow as while offering many explanations as to the hauntings mind games real ghosts space aliens visitors doesnt pick one for definite all that watching radha mitchell talk to her cat and dominic purcell smoulder for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past for nothing say what you like about shyamalan but at least he tells you what happened however crazystupid you might think it if you dont watch a lot of these movies your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat but i found this slow boring and highly derivative if you want to scare yourself silly there are much better places to do it if you want a clever thriller there are many that are smarter,0,0,negative,

during the whole pirates of the caribbean trilogy craze paramount pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this anthony quinn directed cecil b demille supervised movie and getting it on dvd and blu ray with all the extras included it is obvious to me that paramount pictures execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in new orleans louisiana which would have helped make the crescent city once again famous for its pirate connections when the execs at paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then i will be a happy camper paramount pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now,1,-1,neutral,
im not a huge fan of lucio fulcis films most of his 80s gore films had their moments but often came across as secondrate dario argento imitations with the exception of the entertaining zombi which was a george romero imitation i didnt really enjoy them i know italian horror often disregards the plot but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards this is why dont torture a duckling surprised me its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery its possibly the best giallo ever made only seriously rivaled by dario argentos entries into the genre and unlike fulcis previous giallo a lizard in a womans skin this never dragsfulcis direction here is quite good he keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewers interest throughout also the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience plus he adds some clever touches such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence overall the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story the acting is good for the most part also full of familiar faces from 70s italian exploitation cinema both thomas milian and barbara bouchet are super cool throughout the only weak link is florinda bolkan whose performance is just far too overthetop its the only laughable aspect of the film dont torture a duckling definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole 810,1,-1,positive,
the review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent no you shouldnt there are spoilers at the end of this review but how i can spoil this rotten movie i have no idea even if you are a die hard alienpred fan like i am wait for the dvd it isnt worth a 399 rental either but youll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theaterin the theater i watched avpr there were exactly two laughs both by a girl sitting next to me other than that there was total silence throughout no ooohs or that was bad ass nothing imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic now you know what youll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of avprwhat was the budget on this movie like war of the worlds mi 3 and other fx driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the cgi people can come up with than developing characters or a plot spielberg has tried and failed at this several times usually with tom cruise sure the movies make money but should they war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for a decent script tom cruise et al and ss himself but were still awful im sure avp wasted 90 of their budget on cg and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at randomthere is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised who cares who gets killed we didnt know any of them we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit we all know the blood is acid in alien aliens 3 resurrection and even avp the directors make use of the fact that the aliens can think can hide and can lay traps this director decided that the ridley scott james cameron and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed in this installment you will never care who lives or dies not a kid a parent a pregnant woman the characters serve only one purpose in this movie to die the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke the character development scenes mix clichs bad humor and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really dont care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways but they dont the director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films the human protagonists and stealing the rest from other recent scifi filmsthere is not one original use of the either the alien or pred characters the pred actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that pred revered the aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as rite of passage the alienpred is never really developed as a fearsome creature its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was hellboy where samiels dismembered tongue injected eggs into hellboy or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victims throatsimply put we arent given reason to care about anything in this movie there is violence but it doesnt shock or surprise and is nothing that hasnt been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we arent made to care whether or not kids women or anyone else lives or dies we just want the movie to end eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil 2 has a nuke aim gunnisons way to wipe out the infection and not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it in a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for lastsorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating bad script no plot unoriginal action scenes uninspired direction abysmal acting decent fx that were wasted because of the many flawsi dont mind going to an indie film and being disappointed the actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget for a movie with this type of budget and hype i feel cheated along with disappointed this movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits sad to say that a preview of hellboy 2 was the best part of avpr and hb2 didnt even look that good,0,0,positive,

this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life i gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it borrowing some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesnt result in a movie like them if this going to be a top korean movie id rather wont bother to see even a korean movie trailerby the way this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising i think every korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 even though has no clue what it is about,0,0,negative,

this is the story of a maniac cop who for some reason has it in for a young college stud and his mates after they report him to his supervisor who in turns suspends him pending psychiatric evaluation he finds an opportunity to psychology torture them when on a bet the kids hack into a department stores security and unlock the door only they get locked in the store along with the weirdo murder and mayhem are afoot and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escapedangerous game would have been a successful catandmouse psycho thriller probably if it was set in a different location the thought of psychotic cop chasing around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didnt work especially when he comes facetoface with his flinching prey quite frequently and yet does nothing serious quite often there was no real confrontation as would be sufficient for this kind of story and mayve worked better if say for example the teens were loose in the neighborhood and left to fend for themselves against this weirdo especially if that took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoidalthough granted even that is clichdwhat a shame too that it could not have been a better thriller considering a funky cast of young australian characters even a light hearted adventure despite the madness of the villain interspersed through the picture might have even made it a more satisfying picture instead it started out fresh and sure did have plenty of action sequences but wound up verging on the ridiculous,0,-1,neutral,

ordinarily anthony mann made westerns with the big guys james stewart gary cooper henry fonda the a list cowboy stars but in this b film he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western the main character played by victor mature is a trapper mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films robert redford in jeremiah johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men not here for once a true mountain man vulgar crude animalistic is the central figure and its something to see giving mature one of his better later roles the real acting chops are provided by robert preston excellent as a selfabsorbed custer type cavalry commander and james whitmore the poor mans spencer tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officers wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of matures grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that shes attracted to him rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format good show and underrated movie all around,1,-1,positive,

based upon the novel the dismissal by ermanno rea in essence the storys about the slow friendship that develops between an italian maintenance technician vincenzo buonavolonta sergio castellitto who can be seen as the villainous king in prince caspian and was the lead in bella martha and a chinese translator liu hua ling tai they set off actually on the wrong foot with the former chastising the latter for her inaccurate and slow translations of what he wanted to tell a chinese delegate who had bought equipment that is faulty vincenzo wants to do the right thing which is rare in these days and that is to tell the prospective buyers upfront the faults as well as the intricacies that their purchase would bring and given that hes disturbed by the fact that the deal still went ahead he takes time off to craft a component that would set things rightbut that also means to travel to china in search of the elusive machine which proves to be well hidden and seemingly having vanished without a trace with the initial reluctant help of liu hua they set off in this treasure hunt from city to city which brings us to lesser seen sights of china away from the beijings and the shanghais to cities like wuhan with industrial like backdrops such as steel mills and nuclear plants with their smoke stacks dotting the scenery the mighty yangtze river also makes an appearance along the way the usual trappings of such travelogue styled movies come into play such as the learning of culture ideals food and basically the understanding that the world is without strangers if only one makes an effort to try and connect while hints of some romance between the two leads are suggested it rarely made itself to be a moot point until perhaps late in the movie hey opposites attract nobesides the major industrial plants and factories we get to see various cottage industry like seamstresses working in sweat shop like environments and i believe cotton too along with noodle making as a film it provided me the travelling opportunity without leaving my seat to observe and credit to it for not passing judgement from a moral high ground on exploitation and the likes and kudos too for the movie to engage in dialogue based on the characters native tongues rather than and i shall not name names here some other movie crosscultural collaborations where dialogue is forceddubbed and came off unnatural and truly irksome some might deem the supporting characters to be too kind too always opening their arms and doors to a foreigner but i would like to imagine that maybe in the more rural areas people in general tend to be more sincere friendly and basically not get caught up in the rat race to trample on others or be trampled uponif theres a message to take away from the movie besides the fact that i mentioned that the world is without strangers is a reminder to myself that some of the stuff i deem important may not be so to others importance is something one places upon something else and its basis really depends on how we define the boundaries we set so given our finite lifetime i think i should lighten up a bit more live and let live and sometimes bask in the illusion that ignorance could be bliss,1,-1,neutral,

sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind house party 4 down to the last minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off this final installment to the house party series is by far the worst not just sequel but film released by hollywood it becomes very apparent early on in this feature that director chris stokes loved ferris buellers day off with a passion i say this because it becomes very clear that stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of bueller off john hughes hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor you would think that by stealing themes and images from a funnier film your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two with house party 4 stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel much less a hollywood film from his confusing and choppy story the inability to make sense of his characters and recycled oldtired clich moments all stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the house party films it reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue macaroni cat hair chewing gum and straws and presents it as hannibal crossing the alps it just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creatorso where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity honestly i do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long so instead i would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest to begin i still cannot shake the ferris beuller ripoff it was as if director stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to house party and decided to bring in a completely random formula from a funnier film and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula that was a huge mistake when a director tries to do this what eventually happens is confusion within the audience we think that we are going in one direction but instead we head in another one that is exactly what you can witness in house party 4 in one instance we have johnjohn trying to have the biggest party of the decade while also trying to score a record deal ok kinda reminds me of the original house party but then we whisk away to this random island where uncle charles is afraid of flying grandma gets drunk and some idiotic minddulling moments with a supposed killer again we begin somewhat strong and end chaotic this is the confusion in which i speak director stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story he would rather cut corners keep the jokes cheap and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stonedead series one would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another house party film he would walk into it thinking that heshe would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life instead stokes just wanted to get paidi realize that i am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by but i do believe i still keep my hand in the younger generations culture i listened to rap and rb growing up but the group immature never made it to either my cassette deck or my cd player why i dont think they ever quite had a following but apparently to director chris stokes it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new house party film didnt anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly or how about the option to have stokes himself play the comedic car repairman nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor it was one of those few instances when i actually missed robin harris and i never thought i would find myself saying that to any film outside of a gonowhere band playing the lead role i also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film uncle charles was annoying when he attempted humor kim whitely was completely wasted for her scenes both literally and figuratively while well everyone else pretty much falls into that categorywhere did chris stokes spend most of the budget for this film not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some there were definitely none present at the unforgettable house party nor the possible dream that perhaps kid or play would make one final appearance house party 4 followed no preset design which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver routine for humor stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance for once i can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film house party 4 buried the series and while i do hear that there may be more in the pipeline i only hope hollywood realizes that this series has died hollywood needs to let this series end forget about the past and move forward in the future i think a sequel to whos the man would get them started in the right directiongrade out of,0,0,positive,
this was allocated to the fans as the winner takes all match occurred between two separate companies the world wrestling federation and the alliance an amalgamation of former wcw and ecw superstars because the final match to duduce the superior company was a tagteam match the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match interfernce is necessary each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches executes a special move and tags in a partner the storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of vince that a member of the allance would be fradulent and join the wwf it was obvious with that statement that the wwf would prevail overall very innovative storyline but poor execution which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tagteam the remaining matches are just revoltingedge versus test potent big boot by test but this did not display the true talents of both starsal snow versus christian good match but superflous to the payperviewtaji versus william regal the worst match of the nightimmunity battle royal this was an outstandingly fun match to watch but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event only a wrestler who characteristically appears on heat and is probably a wcw lightheavyweight reject ie the hurricane who is merely hired as an entertainerhardy boyz versus dudley boyz the best match of the night jeff hardy executed a swanton bomb from the summit of a cage and through a wooden table and matt was wedged into the cage which appeared to be extremely painfulbecause stone cold was the wwf champion rob van dam was the hardcore champion and kurt angle was a mole in the alliance all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of the alliance were granted work after the matchs outcome except for booker t who recently attacked a wrestler on raw and will inevitably be given work shane mcmahon will return to television somehow and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of the alliance to see stone cold out of work the wwf has done much better a match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better and what ever became of casket and iron man matches,0,0,positive,

i loved the the film it beautifully analyzes italian petty bourgeois society how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they dont want disturbed for instance the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son and doesnt want to be reminded of his more radical youthfor a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on tv but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market even in italy no one in the book shops knew about the film a great pitythe one sex scene which everyone seems to go on about does the film no harm,1,1,positive,
the bbc and the arts entertainment network should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this unfortunate production onto the world the acting is with the exception of robert hardy as general tilney amateurish at best and excruciatingly painful at worst the costumes are overthetop and feature some truly ghoulish excesses was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for womens hats surely every woman in bath didnt have feathers in her headpiece in the early 19th century the production values are poor and the pacing of the film makes one feel it was hastily and clumsily edited at the last minute altogether an agonizing film that i had to force myself to watch to the end its a shame as the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and location shooting compared to emma thompsons sublime sense and sensibility or the extraordinary 1995 production of pride and prejudice or the subtle intensity of 1995s persuasion this production of northanger abbey surely has jane austen turning in her grave,0,0,positive,
disclaimer during my ventures into foreign cinema i have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror action drama comedy and romance to name a few thus i have enjoyed the thoughtful serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless popcorn fun of action films with a wide array of chinese japanese and korean movies under my belt i am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement unfortunately ashes of time has nothing to recognize it is one of the worst chinese movies i have ever seento start off this overrated swordplay epic showcases the infamous slideshow action sequence throughout which is nothing more than an ultracheap and pathetic form of action choreography one simply needs to show a series of closeup pictures of grimising faces swords legs andor arms and then a dead body bravissimo you now have an action sequence for ashes of time the problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going onthe dramatic element of this film is nonexistent as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing such elements on screen which renders all characters generic and colorless leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions in fact the storyline itself is an absolute disaster introducing way too many characters way too quickly with way too many plot devices plot complexities in films can be used very advantageously ie a tale of two sisters but ashes of time becomes exploitative trash when it does nothing more than convolute a very simple plot for no apparently good reasonin fact this entire movie acts like a series of smokescreens to cover up its deficiencies horrible action choreography is covered up by slideshow tricks and chaotic camera movements nonexistent character development is covered up by the characters overtly saying how they feel and a thoughtless storyline is covered up by confusing the viewer with convolutionas if this werent bad enough this movie was extremely boring seeming more like 150 minutes instead of the actual 95rating a rarely given 05 stars,0,0,positive,
i turned this on to see the incredible ethel waters whose autobiography i am now reading ill admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece its pretty much a short film made by blacks for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time old trends exaggerated for humor we see modern black movies do the same thing but with the new trends stereotypes hos and the hood and such i think if you look back in eighty years you would find todays movies will look just as racist what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the pintsized sammy davis jr who out taps his contemporary shirley temple and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it why not enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been,1,-1,neutral,
the plot its not so original if someone saw lultimo bacio theres nothing new a wealthy family in rome living everyday life thats is boring and false with everyone asking to others what they think about them really boring after an half of hour because its simple to understand where the story is going to finish this because its simple to see the moralistic view of muccino in this movie so even the hardest parts seem normal to summarise in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said the family saw from a 30 years old i dont like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations really good how muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and its the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it morante was intense and great as usual but unfortunatly on a bad movie,0,0,positive,

one of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film to have it totally wash over you so that you absorb it as it is and thus experience it to the fullest every time i see it the egyptian is such a film over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities but perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics it is at once forbidding remote possibly dangerous beware of what lies within the haunting chords of the music seen over the 20thfox logo usher us into titles of otherworldly turquoise letteringstrange archaeological decadent it is as if we are descending into some vault of antiquity wherein might be great treasures mixed with uncertain hazards one might imagine darryl zanuck commanding make it ancient then what a darkly dramatic story unfolds all within the same tone set at the startof hollywoods mid50s egyptian trilogy the ten commandments portrayed the civilizations sternness the phenomenal land of the pharaohs its nuts and bolts while the egyptian shows it all from glamour to tragedy for us to wonder atno need to say much about the players here but i think that with the passage of time bella darvi is being redeemed what a perfect face for the role right out of a symbolist painting if her acting does not please some it might be argued that in her role as a courtesan she is obviously better in bed than yakking to some poor helpless admirer i think that curtiz captured the kinkiness of her sadomasochistic relationship with edmund purdoms character with aplomb censorship being what it was at the time sir peter ustinov in his memoirs was pretty kind to the egyptian writing that it was like being lost in a huge set for aida his pronunciation of the word beer i have adopted myself ever afterone of the films historically accurate references the egyptians invented beer henry daniell egads what a perfect performance gene tierney what a screen treasure bless dfz for giving her this late role cmon folks dont be so hard on victor mature hes a cheesemakers son who rose to be pharaoh sounds like a peculiarly american opportunity one of the best moments john carradines existential observations on the sands of time and purdoms utterance about dwelling beyond the sunset of the world if that isnt grade a epicness what isof course along with everything else the music is sublime it is frequently noted that alfred newman and bernard herrmann created one of the screens most compelling scores perfectly harmonious yet each theme is well developed with a life of its own newman pressed for time by dfz called in herrmann someone he could trust implicitly to take up half the burdenbenny not the easiest guy to work with obviously respected newman enough to really deliver inspiring music they alternated cues an ingenious approach no spoilers as to who did what here but benny brings an edge with him mysterious awesome sounds alfred brings fulsomeness longing poignancy both are consummately epic even when seen on a squeezed tv print the effect of seeing the two composers names side by side in the main credits which the ultrawide anamorphic screen could comfortably accommodate is spinetinglingleon shamroy the dean of cinemascope does not let us down here the lurid greens and moody shadows probably distortions in all the terrible tv prints ive seen through the years perfectly accompany the multidimensional script by the great philip dunne and wb vet casey robinson whom curtiz mustve brought with him to 20th how remarkable it is that shamroy who was as much of an institution of cinematography at fox as newman was with music would lens cleopatra a few years later but in the brighter sharper images of 60s todd ao these old studio guys are really heroes of mineto me who wants to fret about all the imperfections and criticism opportunities in a picture like this id rather yield entirely to its spell and dive off into its sea of lavishness to emerge after the inspiring climax of the end refreshed moved and hungry for moreand yes we should cry out to 20thfox for a dvd release worthy of dfzs legacy,1,0,positive,

this is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right the plot cutdowns might disappoint the fans of the book but really how many modern readers have read bleak house without seeing a film version first i know of only a few i think it is quite appalling to see reviews critical of the series which have clearly been written by people who havent a clue about the story did you actually see the series or did you just bag a bbc production because gillian anderson was in the newer versionthe series captures the mood pace characters and plotdrivers cutting out the dickensian flourishes which arent needed and detract from a film treatment like the turveydrop story the smallweed family dynamic and the extra lawyers tangle vholes etc are very truncated the only omission that i wish had been kept was the jellyby incident but as the first episode is already a trifle slow after the first episode the pace is perfect i can see it had to go the only other criticism i have is that jos death could have been more faithfully done i can see that would have practically canonized woodcourt and hes kept a little more human for not having that scene but really i think jos death is one of the most poignant points of the book and i missed it even though it always makes me cryhas theowinthrop actually seen the series how did he think that esther was raised by her aunt and uncle who is this uncle i suppose someone who could mistake the name of denholm eliott for desmond isnt really an appreciator of english art film or literaturei also think he mistakes the treatment of the law yes the law is drawn very badly in bleak house it fails the descendants of jarndyce whose valuable inheritance is eaten up by the costs of litigation it fails the deceased tom jarndyce and rick carstone and all who have faith in the suit it fails miss flyte in some sense it also fails captain hawdon who is driven to his death by the monotony of law copyist work yes it feeds the scavengers of vholes and tangle but it also makes men like guppy and kenge able to move beyond their station in life though not kind to social statusclimbers dickens clearly would have preferred that they werent bound to being stuck in the station to which they were born contrast jo and the brickmakers families to the climbing out of poverty by charley neckett also the law while misused by tulkinghorn and the chancery vultures is actually the source of security for the wards of the court ada and richard and for esther who is simply jarndyces ward their security was ensured by the law which delivers them to jarndycei cant see how anyone could have trouble following the story remember you arent supposed to realize esther is lady dedlocks daughter right at the beginning neither are you supposed to get all the connections immediately instant gratification just doesnt happen in dickensas for seeing clearly through the fog gosh the gillian anderson had such scatty editing that i found it impossible to follow and i knew the plot alreadyi found diana rigg absolutely brilliant overacting and drama dont make a good lady dedlock but if you think they do try the gillian anderson versionits ada and rick not kate and you get all you need of the rouncewell subplot,1,1,positive,
if you hit your teens in the 70s as i did you probably remember the stories about studio 54 whether or not you liked disco an exclusive club it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and selfabsorption theres even an excellent vh1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating filmsadly this isnt it 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees a bartender named shane ryan phillippe a busboy named greg breckin meyer his wife a coatcheck girl anita selma hayek and of course the master of ceremonies himself steve rubell mike meyers while the goingson at the club are well represented this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers following shanes story the closestthe movie works in spurts sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture such as when shane is taken to a dinner party and doesnt know who errol flynt is and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama some of that is inherent in the premise following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous but a lot of it is due to the kidgloved treatment with which both the club and rubell are given throughout the movie while rubell certainly electrified the scene in new york with his penchant for overthetop spectacle and his exclusive handpicking of the crowds each night the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on and rubell himself while his excesses are mentioned come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar a cheat a drug abuser and promiscuous as all hell not that i was looking for the man to be pilloried here but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate a final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurdmeyers does his best to capture rubell but hes given so little to work with here its surprising his performance is effective but hes good and he helps to anchor the film philippe whom i find generally to be a good actor is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character hes limited to a deerintheheadlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown and even he cant translate that into a strong performance hayek and meyer are both okay again undercut by the writing and neve campbell prominently featured on the dvd cover appears so briefly she really has an extended cameofor some reason i still find myself interested even fascinated by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies but even given that this is not a film that particularly engaged me despite a predisposition to like it id say if that era or that club has any interest for you track down the vh1 special rather than this middleoftheroad melodrama,0,1,positive,
i dont understand the humor in this film i also found it offensive on how koreans were depicted in that film despite how it is actually just a caricature of koreans in those areas first the actors are japanese and they make the most rude expressions of koreans in that film it disgusts me on how these people are expressed i felt anger just watching that one scene and how they were so badly made out in the film the humor lasts just for one laugh and then you dont understand why its even funny its crude humor with the most disgusting representation of society there i found it to be an offensive film overall maybe it was just because i never lived in the hood or saw any hood movies but i dont intend to either,0,0,negative,

ok a warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian be careful about who you see this film with ie do not take kids to see this film ill explain why1 the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance i assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf but is annoying 2 the film itself is really very very disturbing i have some problems first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a horror film but it is a very disturbing film and involves a child and his parents and a small townok it boils down to this the film is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are unsettling and would be confusing to a child is has a bizarre quality to it and its only because it has a child in it that makes me feel its unsuitable as a parent myself i feel strongly enough to want to tell people because i read only the other day that it is having a release in theatresi hope im not offending the film makers by saying this but i think its my right because its getting a release and has an m rating onlybecause its not violent or sexual just weird and unsettling but pretty good in and of itself,1,-1,neutral,

western union is something of a forgotten classic western perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on dvd in the united states however all is not lost as it has now appeared on region 2 in england this being a blessing in some ways is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely american organization as the western union telegraph company is without a region 1 release it beggars belief it simply doesnt make senseproduced by fox in 1941 western union was directed by fritz lang this was only the second occasion the great german director undertook to direct a western he had done an excellent job the year before with foxs the return of frank james and would have only one more western outing in 1952 with the splendid rancho notorious lang was no ford or hawks but with western union he turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well beautifully photographed in early three strip technicolor by edward cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by robert young randolph scott and dean jagger the female lead is taken by virginia gilmore who really has little to do in the picture an actress who never made anything of her career her presence here is merely cosmeticit is curious that robert young has top billing over scott it is clearly scotts picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the films terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains young doesnt have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western he just looks plain silly going up against barton mclane in a gunfight an actor who never really distinguished himself except perhaps with crossfire 1947 young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with his greatest success when for seven years he was tvs marcus welby md in the seventies he died in 1998 at the age of 91western union recounts the connection by telegraph wire of omaha and salt lake city scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by western union boss dean jagger to protect the line from marauding sioux and to also take on mclane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends robert young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with scott for the affections of miss gilmore some comic relief is provided by and irritatingly so some would say by slim summerville and john carradine turns up in a meager role as the company doctoraltogether though a spanking good western albeit on region 2 but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with my only crib is that there are no extras not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics ughfootnote interestingly the associate producer on western union was harry joe brown who later with randolph scott would create a partnership that would produce some of scotts finest westerns in the fifties,1,1,positive,
me neither but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time theres nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie and my name is modesty whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level its full of bactors but isnt any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously it sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growingup drama flashback style the beautiful alexandra staden smothered beyond recognition under makeup more resembles a cast member from top model than modesty blaise im not one of those diehard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious graphic novels to be pitchperfect in fact ive never even read modesty blaise all i wanted was a decent movie to watch but this wasnt it the film feels halffinished with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot it also takes its audience for idiots explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago i guess they think we all have alzheimersnow i love a good bmovie whats better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a calzone and modesty is directed by none other than scott spiegel who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick from dusk till dawn 2 texas blood money i loved from dusk till dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad bmovie should bring to the table nudity gore guns you name it modesty is just dull the flashback concerning modestys life isnt interesting the acting isnt bad enough to be laughed at in fact i kinda liked nikolaj coasterwaldaus hey buddy pseudonyms are your friends performance as the baddieso overall its just lame weak uninspired call it what you will dont watch anything because tarantino presents it people this is just a very forgettable halfhearted thriller and it never tries to be more than that allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun seriously even im cringing my name is modesty a modesty waste of time 410,0,0,positive,
well the movie is basically about the last days of a specific russian regiment stationed in afghansitan before the main troop withdrawal in 1985 the movie accurately portrays the grim realities of russian army that have made it infamous dedovshina officers and ncos physically harassing beating and humiliating younger recruits mixed character of war you can trade with your enemy one day and kill him the next life of women at the front lines documentary footages of helicopter assaults and coffins being soldered and sent home in heave c130 hercules class russian cargo planes with tracer to jam stinger missiles fatigue boredom antiwar sentiment emotional side simply put the theres some action scenes but they are poorly done and often are illogical like major banduras suicidal walk and turning of his back to 10yearold kid armed with ak47 whos father he just killed also the fact that in the middle of firefight in the mountains heavy grenade launcher pops out of nowhere and any halfbright person knows that its virtually impossible to hump 4050 lns launcher on the march anyone but at the same time films shows that war is a dirty affair where murder is sometimes condoned wanton destruction of whole villages for little or no reason is normal indiscriminate killing of civilians is overlooked as collateral damage inevitable during war some food for thought as to why afghan war as lost not the best war movie made but profound and intelligent enough to be worth watching,1,0,positive,
rating 7 out of 10 directed by barbet schroeder if you like hitchcocks rope then you will like this movie murder by numbers stars sandra bullock as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective cassie mayweather her partner is sam kennedy a nondiscriminatory detective played by ben chaplin the teenage killers are high school students richard haywood ryan gosling and justin pendleton michael pitt these young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killersthe supporting characters include a police chief an assistant district attorney and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on the movie reminds me of various hitchcock movies crossed with the tv show law and order we see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they dontthe other plot in the movie relates to cassie mayweathers past and incarcerated exhusband most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving but i found this to the most intriguing part of the storymurder by numbers is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe or should i say dangerous murder mystery for more thrills and suspense try se7en or hitchcocks dial m for murder,1,1,positive,

ok as far as the 2 versions of this movie there were 2 people involved in the making john korty and bill couterie george was just the producer he really didnt have any kind of say so in the film just helped with money the adult version was made possible by bill couterie john korty didnt like or approve this version as it was done behind his back thanks to ladd films going under they didnt advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for the right stuff hoping it would pull them through and it didnt so this movie never really had a chance when twice made it to cable hbo they showed the reels with bills version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore did you notice how the adult version wasnt on for very long showtime got the clean version the version on the videotape and laserdisc is the version approved by john who holds more power than bill its a pity really as the adult version is actually better and does make more sense but its very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd or any other format short of bootleg sorry to disappoint everyone i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club still have numerous items from the movie used to own a letterboxed version of the adult version but it was stolen only have a partial hbo copy of it now 8 stars to the adult version 5 to the clean version any other questions just ask,1,-1,neutral,

when i saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy american movie done on the cheap with appalling actors i was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong the movie centres around bartely or b who has been rejected from all of his colleges the actor who play b is very natural and makes his character seem real and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him however loads of people see his fake website and join feeling their sorrows b cant turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate the college is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing the school faces opposition from the proper college which ends up closing it down the film ends on a high and i recommend you watching it its does have it flaws but it is a feel good cheerful film with a few unpredictable twists,1,-1,positive,

this movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever the acting was pathetic jordan hinson could not show any upset emotions at the beginning of the movie she was supposed to be discouraged instead she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out she sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene i was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses they had to pluck out her everyone else was suffering from overacting as well it was flat out annoying it was also an insult to figure skaters jordan took a month to train and they cast her as a person who makes the olympic team its practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work a pitiful excuse for a movie and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating dont waste your life it doesnt even deserve one star,0,-1,neutral,

this is a badly made poor remake of bimaldas classic parineeta the story is based on sarat chandras book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity the acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham shekars fathers choice of words in abusing lolita balan sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story again the scene where shekhar saif slaps lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters is quite jarring to the senses and could have been easily avoided similarly the sex scene between saif and balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience when a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit the work falls apart the song piyu bole is quite ok another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father this is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit on these counts this movie deserves 3 stars the song and dance by rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on the song is tuneful but i remember having heard it somewhere before and if iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized well agreed the times have changed from then to now but then this movie is not even reflective of the modern timesthis is what happens when the modern bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the nris and grabbing the lucrative nri entertainment market such movies end up neither belonging to india nor to any other part of the world,0,0,negative,
if the movies are to be believed chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their western counterparts the storylines of the three chinese ghost films are largely identical but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that its not a huge problem as always humour is an integral part of the film accompanied of course by a great deal of mugging for those who havent encountered the chinese ghoststory trilogy yet this film offers an interesting departure from the western horrorghost genre for those who have another enjoyable romp in the chinese ghost world,1,1,positive,

the screaming skull opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it now theres a hook the story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness then attempts to convince her that shes going insane with shrill noises mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the mans first wife who he was devoted to maybe its just that the 1950s didnt have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane but then again when i first saw house on haunted hill as a nine year old it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way im sure this film did for young viewers of the same eradont get me wrong the film is not terrible it just seems to get tedious at times but theres some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished whitlock home and the gardens and pool are a nice touch for me the best played out scene involves eric whitlock john hudson going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull he just wades right in clothes and all in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener director alex nicol in a dual role it makes you wonder who the real dimwit wasin its own good way perhaps the most shocking thing about the film how about that neat roadster the whitlocks make their first appearance in gull wing doors in 1958 that at least made me jump out of my seat,0,-1,positive,

in what must be one of the most bloodfreezing movies ever a transvestite is murdering people in new york and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect one can see how brian depalma takes some influence from hitchcock with camera angles and stuff michael caine plays a most thoughtprovoking character while angie dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo keith gordon who later starred in christine is probably the most interesting character in the movie but you cant really understand this movie without seeing it and after seeing it you may never know just whom you can trust also starring nancy allen and dennis franz,1,0,negative,

apparently a massive head wound is the cure for homicidal tendencies turning a murderous sociopath into a lovable and oafish dog catcher also this ones for the ladies it seems that the front gate of a psychiatric hospital is an overlooked hot spot for meeting potential mates those are just two of the approximately 23 absurdities were supposed to accept for this movie to have any meaning i love movies and i believed as im assuming many americans do forgive me if im wrong that hollywood turned out the best product ive come to learn how sadly naive and brainwashed i was and 2 how much more sophisticated europeanasian cinema is in comparison to its american counterparti watched this allegedly disturbing psychological thriller the night following a viewing of a japanese movie called suicide club as the camera faded on walter sparrows happy little family enjoying some quality time around a prison visiting room table not to mention the patronizing voiceover extolling the virtue of doing the right thing i suddenly had an epiphany i had just finished watching a movie that left me feeling as though id just had a glass of water when i really wanted a beer my thirst was sated but it was strictly utilitarian the premise was mildly interesting but the story itself with its innumerable coincidences how do we explain her finding the book well just say something likeor did the book find her theyll buy that gaping plot holes why did wifey take the skeleton predictability and obligatory happy ending turned out to be just another hollywood hack job additionally the casting of jim carrey was just wrong at any moment i felt he was capable of breaking into some shtick from one of his stupid comedies or in living color jim carrey as a tattooed hardboiled police detective who enjoys bondage and rough sex didnt buy it for a secondyou want disturbing deeply disturbing watch suicide club the story surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 school girls the film opens with a group of giggling high schoolers mulling about on a subway train platform we then watch in horror as they line up hold hands and happily throw themselves in front of a fast moving commuter train needless to say much chaos ensues thats as far as im going to go with the story line because i encourage the reader to see the film in fact im not sure if i could outline the plot even if i wanted to what begins as a straightforward mystery quickly descends into a madhouse of grotesque imagery did i understand the movie no not initially like many of the foreign films my girlfriend has introduced me to so naturally i thought it was bad but this one lingered in my mind i went to bed thinking on the film and awoke the next morning and looked it up on imdb i read some of the viewer comments and was astonished at 1 the insights others had derived from the film and 2 the fact that i had so thoroughly missed the whole point of the movie i realized that i was so used to being spoon fed the message from hollywood that when confronted with a film that actually required the viewer to participate to actually think for themselves i was totally unequipped its as if i had been conditioned to check my brain at the door of the theateram i saying that suicide club is the greatest movie ever made of course not it has its flaws many of which were reported adroitly by the imdb reviewers am i saying that all american movies are bad and all foreign movies are good again of course not my point is that theres a whole world of filmmaking outside of hollywood a body of work that engages the viewer forces them to think and question movies that dont telegraph plot twists follow a strict linear sequence and above all dont insult the intelligence of the person watching i look forward to expanding my mind while exploring this new world of film that doesnt do the thinking for me,0,-1,positive,

okay so ive read most of the reviews on this movie as well as comments left by visitors to this site and the feeling i get is that most people who wrote reviews really didnt like this movie thats why im writing nowi represent the minority because i did i admit i went to see the movie because i am very impressed with ryan goslings compelling abilities and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible he is an amazing actor that aside i wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me why because its a whodunit where you know whodunit from the start and thats kind of unusualas the plot goes two teenage boys endeavour to commit the perfect crime because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly freethe uninhibited and lets remember guiltless acting out of ones will the relationship between richard and justin was complex hinted at homosexuality and was brilliantly acted by ryan gosling and michael pitt gosling was the manipulating controlling smoothtalker and pitt was the extremely booksmart socially awkward outcast enter sandra bullocks character who it seems most people didnt particularly appreciate i think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a selfglorification thing i didnt see that as the case here without cassies personal history about the exhusband that nearly killed her who not surprisingly shared similar traits with richard hayward she never would have pursued her instincts about justin and richard the case was seemingly airtight against ray the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie neither bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other and the vomit justin left at the sight therein lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing the guiltless acting out of will as true freedom ended up working against justin who ended up having a conscience after all and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site without that crucial piece of evidence they almost had a murder by numbers and to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as i have i looked in to it and found that something done by numbers such as a painting suggests careful and critical planning and exacting theres also a song by sting called murder by numbers but thats beside the point many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between cassie and her partner but i think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her history like it or not her history does play an important role in this movie because without it she would likely have never followed her instincts about justin and richard yes it was a bit of the cliche women scorned woman acting out vendetta in every facet of her life plot but i think without the depth of cassies character you have just another movie about teenage killers and they just may have gotten away with it theres no movie thereand to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didnt commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning can i remind you that the reason was because of the purposely placed and totally traceable shoe prints the boys wanted to be involvedit was a game they were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth what they didnt expect was that cassie mayweather had an overactive case of instinct working on her side a little unbelievable maybe but many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts however this is a moviei saw this movie in theatres about three times and each time it revealed a little more to me and i liked it a little more the more i watched it the more i was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth richard haywardthere are people really like this my main complaint about the movie would be that they should have had justin and richards interactions a little more central because lets face it there lays the intrigue in the entire film and my main props go to characterizationeach character was very distinct and interesting in hisher own way it was very well acted although i would have given ben chaplins character a little more depth to work with hes a good actor and maybe pared down bullocks character a smidgeni think everyone should keep in mind that for a hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the whodunit at the beginning it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end i think they did so quite well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout slow revelation of the different character dynamics and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors ryan gosling and michael pitt i think if we remove our innate cynicism and attempt to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are we may be able to look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this movie if only in the characters who were brilliantly portrayed especially richard hayward not that im biassed,1,1,positive,

i picked this title up from a friend who had it sitting in his exhaustive dvdvideolaserdisc collection so luckily i didnt personally have to pay for it i had an inkling that it would be a bad film but i know what a truly bad film is after watching greats like children shouldnt play with dead things and the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixedup zombies and now there is truly nothing that fazes me unless it is astoundingly badsolar crisis is bad but it doesnt reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are atanyway the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it in order to counteract this imminent threat humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to fire an antimatter bomb which the opening describes as the biggest explosive ever into the sun which through some convoluted scifi logic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angle leaving earth unharmednever mind that what i have just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original star trek even with an ensemble cast charlton heston peter boyle and jack palance solar crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity thanks to a plot that starts simple yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears onthe crowning achievement of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character played by boyle who insists on sabotaging the mission through means that are never explained he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the space crews genetically engineered scientist played by female lead annabel schofield why is he sabotaging the mission because by his moronic viewpoint he believes the flare wont happen and that when it doesnt he will become fabulously wealthy because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market in effect you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation imaginablethe films plot becomes amazingly convoluted and develops very slowly in time tapping the use of characters who have only vague or uselessly brief roles in the storyline i could sit here and explain in detail precisely what happens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a plot that actually clicks or holds your attention but i am sitting here writing this review on microsoft word and i know for a fact that this would take three pages and i would only succeed in losing your interest but then again you would probably get the same effect from watching the filmanyway the film is miserably bogged down with exceedingly poor dialogue imagine if all that ever happened on the star trek enterprise was that the characters spewed scifi jargon back and forth at eachother yes i know they already do that but imagine if thats all they did and that they used said jargon to set up vague and nearnonsensical scenes that produce no excitement tension or interest in the viewer whatsoeverthis is best exemplified at the point when a character in a zerog environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before proceeding to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding the script alludes previously to the character risking an explosion but doesnt bother to give any solid answer as to why or how this occurs nor why he cant really escape in totality you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the laughablethen we have several scenes where dramatic buildup leads to nothing jack palances performance is wasted on a character that serves only to drive the boy hero dont ask around the desert before getting roughed up and killed by a bunch of suits on his deathbed palance finally tells our boy hero his last name while wearing a horrible bruised makeup job that makes it look like somebody put a balloon under his eyeball which he kept quiet about before colonel travis j richards the boy repeats it quietly after he expires giving viewers the impression that the name is of some significance later on in the film perhaps charlton hestons grizzled admiral character knows him and the plot will advance thereby once his name is repeated something anythingnope sorry any hopes you have will be dashed when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic failed attempts at creating dramafor a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on palances career just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marredcompleting the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring schofield

that even for the visibly elaborate care put into them still always manage to make the film look just as chintzy as it really is the saddest part about this film is the obviously large budget

although it has been off the air for 6 years now promised land was one of those shows that comes along once or twice in a generation good cast supporting castamong them richard thomas and ossie davis and crew the plot is believable with mcraney packing up his family and just saying to hell with it all after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from vietnam years earlier i think a lot of vietnamera veterans myself included could really relate to mcraneys thought process in finally deciding on his course of action many of us did precisely the same thing in real life after returning from that war and finding that america was not the same place we left the show imparts not only values but a glimpse into what took place in one veterans life in those two respects alone i think it is one of the more poignant tv series of our time why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me,1,-1,neutral,
well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that i signed up for an imdb account just to warn people it is patently awful nothing makes sense in this movie there is way too many subplots for a start josh hartnetts character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo harrison fords character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the internal affairs investigators exwife who happens to run a psychic radio show which fords character calls from time to time nonsensei cant remember the characters names thats how forgettable this is so ill refer to them as ford and hartnettthen theres the dialogue which is brutal i mean cringeinducing stuff here throw in every clich in the book having a hearttoheart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name the duo being investigated by internal affairs why hartnett confronting his dads killer and youve got one hell of a messas i mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is nonexistent 1 when fords car is being repossessed how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked were they following him 2 when hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene an earring is replicated on of the charred bodies there that was lucky 3 when the two are arrested and taken in for questioning ford keeps answering his phone and hartnett centers himself with a yoga pose on the table instead of taking the phone from ford the ia guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before ford does meanwhile the female ia officer in with hartnett is rubbing herself all over him then inexplicably the two are released without answering any questions 4 during the car chase hartnetts car is crashing and smashing its way around hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again not a scratch 5 when ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at 6 when the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnetts car ford is trying to close a real estate deal come on 7 the bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever his motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label they might leave his label and its a warning to keep his other groups loyal but hang on how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan 8 why is the ia guy who is investigating ford arrested in the end there is no explication 9 and hartnett gets to use his acting to capture the bad guy in the endi could go on i really could anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because thats all it is theres nothing else to it its not supposed to be satirical or ironic its just crap,0,0,positive,
i love this show its truly unique i was under the impression it was going to have more seasons in anticipation of series 2 recently i purchased series 1 to rewatch it in order to be refreshed when part 2 started now after watching it i was excited and craving more so i came to the site to see the schedule for the continuation i am really disappointed to see there no longer are plans for a second series as i was eagerly looking forward to watching more of this story i think they really dropped the ball on this one there was plenty of story line left to build on and lots of unanswered questions im now a very unhappy view and i hope that they would reconsider their decision and pick up the story where it left off,1,-1,positive,
from the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes keanu im so wooden i could be a plank me reeves look like an oscar winner this film bites pun not intended the best thing about it is the box of eraticate in the 2nd segment which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and twist wish id spent the 399 it cost me on something else like erm natural born killers directors cut if you do buy this youre really in for a disappointment do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague if youre looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead however if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere like dog soldiers wolfen romasantathe werewolf hunt,0,-1,positive,

this movie is certainly wellconstructed beginning and ending in the dark with focus on lili smith schmidt julie andrewsinitially the singing angel later the notorious spyits beautiful i saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently while it was dismissed by critics in the 70s as overblown cinema vulgaris and lacking in structure among others time has proven them wrong blake edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical qualitythe film soars and swirls aerial photography julie andrews in motion and captivates one must just buy into the premise that julie andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong overlooking the tepid chemistry between julie andrews and rock hudson one must believe that these are lovers who in all innocence fall for each other and in the end love is far more important than winning wars and so is maintaining innocencethere is a lot of understated acting and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comediesthere are wonderful comedic elements foreshadowing the french goons in victorvictoria interesting diplomatic asides reminding me of the tamarind seed seen about 18 years ago and a general sense of goodwillsuspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away julie andrews belting out of war songs and the haunting whistling away the dark are reason enough to turn the tv on just for the soundtrack and the striptease number like the jenny number in star works this film has like a good champagne aged well paramount should bring it to dvd as soon as possible the same applies to transferring the laser disk of star to dvd these are both interesting pieces of julie andrews meticulous and then underrated works,1,1,positive,

another first this french movie is my introduction to the world eric rohmer perhaps im a bit hasty when i say that this is probably my last rohmer movie but i was immediately turned off by the way rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point there is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that i thought was never going to end honestly no matter how much i tried i couldnt understand why rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles he struck me as being one of those obnoxiously petulant people who are filled with hot air if this is a sample of what his movies are about im not interested i dont care much for french cinema usually reflective and speculative to a fault so maybe im biased,0,-1,positive,
vivah is by no means a classic however in the days of hardcore action pathbreaking special effects complex plots none of which bollywood has mastered yet its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah the story as we all know is a journey from a couples first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times nothing more nothing less the music isnt quite in the same league as mpk or hahk but doesnt jar your senses either two songs stood out for me mujhe haq hai do anjaane while milan abhi aadha hamaari shaadi were hummable shahid performs sincerely shows a lot of potential its good to see him play something else but the cool dude he normally does amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile smalltown girl to perfection alok nath anupam kher seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job surajs direction is simple but effective the movies prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers but all in all a good clean decent family movie,1,-1,positive,
first what i didnt like the acting was not really up to the hamlet standard branagh was really overthetop doing a lot of yelling mostly in my opinion those actors who were not bigname celebrities generally did a better job though i would except billy crystal and robin williams and charlton heston too but i wasnt sure if he was playing at being a hack a lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbackswhat i think speaks very much in this plays favor is that it is accessible shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays many people are not even inclined to try because of its reputation as serious literature and its archaic english if they see this film they will understand clearly at least one mans interpretation of the play they will be seeing it more as shakespeares audiences saw it a play with sword fights and battles and mighty kings and nobles murder and incest and evil schemes and ghostsand great art if one cares to look for it but in shakespeares day most didnt any more than most people do now branaghs overacting and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer may detract from shakespeares art somewhat but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it rather than nothingive got to say one more thing though some people are complaining that its set in the 19th century and that wasnt shakespeares time well in shakespeares time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays shakespeare may have said its in the days of ancient rome or medieval denmark or whatever but he didnt dress his characters up like they were he used the costumes of his own time for the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms for example in king john the english and french have cannonsin robin hoods day in julius caesar they talk of chimneys which wouldnt be invented for another thousand years and in henry iv they talk about machiavelli who wasnt even born yet then so i think this objection is sillyyou might as well complain that the play isnt in danish after all they live in denmark dont they,1,1,positive,
i had to compare two versions of hamlet for my shakespeare class and unfortunately i picked this version everything from the acting the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera to the camera shots all medium or close up shotsno scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots were absolutely terrible i watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that i feel that i was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation not recommended by any stretch of the imagination,0,0,negative,
considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films i have no argument with that although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining one thing its the longest of the series that ive seen at 105 minutes ive only seen six of them but this was longer than im used to and with the drawnout action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too longnonetheless it is a good mixture of action suspense and romance the only things missing are color and stereo sound the primitive specialeffects dont bother me as that was all that they had back in the 1930samong some this film is most noted for one thing skin jane never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made her outfit showed what a great figure maureen osullivan possessed the nude underwater scene however was not her by a longshot the woman under the water didnt have a good figure at all whoever it wasthere is plenty of action in here up to the finale it was not overdone either the ending went on for 15 minutes though and was so intense that it was almost too much to watchstill this movie offers about everything except boy their adopted son youd want to see in a tarzan film even osullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times with her pair of lungs that was no problem,1,1,positive,

considering the lack of art with in african cinema or black american cinema the idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers but the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short but it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking the genre is unique and not the typical expectation it is almost this departure which first catches the eye so watching it twice is critical the film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinemaand it is this true art that with an african voice that is extremely rare the film doesnt copy to attain its message it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes not racial but character based stereotypes from a writers perspective the film is brilliant it carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development it must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly the usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended but considering the director owen alik shahadahs last venture 500 years later music is to be expected but from a theme pointof view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problembrilliant stuff,1,1,positive,
this movie is bizarre better put its freakin weird i could give you a plot summary or some hoity toity analysis but i would consider it a waste of your time all anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters one incestuous relationship homicide post mortem mutilation and one really disturbing infatuation at the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself but not in a good way like after pulp fiction or fight club its like youre a teenager or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenagerand have just done something you a wish you hadnt done and b hope to the good lord of heaven and earth that your parents never find out about and nobody likes that my advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch kazaamyes i would rather watch kazaam than murderous maids read into it what you want,0,0,negative,
history and experience over the past couple of decades has shown us that intellectuals talking about sex is about the unsexiest and unintellectual thing anyone can do but this wasnt quite as obvious back in 1986 basically the idea in this film is that these characters insatiable drive to find comfort security and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselveswhich they hide from themselves with more sex this drive is linked to the decline of the american empire as expressed in an early interview within the movieso the idea is that relatively detestable people talk about sex and that that talk is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people arcand at least keeps giving it drive and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera such as isolating most of the characters in single frames revealing their ultimate loneliness and cutting rapidly between them showing how they are more at war with each other than they are at agreement and to give arcand credit this is pretty much what intellectual life is a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alonebut yeah the characters and action are unsexy and kind of pathetic i think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something meant to last which makes it kind of dated its also the exact type of mental buffing in dialog and references to people like susan sontag that makes arthouse films so unpopular around the populist entertainment moviegoers in all ill take it anywayit has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters areits just that its not really interesting or important to anyone who isnt those characterspolarisdib,0,-1,neutral,

yet again i appear to be the only person on planet earth who is capable of criticizing japanese films made before 1970 fires on the plain 1959 is another in the seemingly endless line of classics that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason as much as i love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film its still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of masterpiece what i find truly ironic is that fans of derivative classics like fires on the plain focus so much on inside the box moviemaking orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting acting camerawork etc yet it always seems like the most highly revered classics are most deficient in these very standards for example one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial most surprisingly the very first scene in fires on the plain uses this indolent tactic to the extremeafter a funny head slap the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer why cant you grasp the situation we landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at tacloban we lost twothirds of our men our artillery was sunk in transit we tried to reach burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible the enemys counterattack forced a fanout across the valley you know that so why exactly is one character telling another character something he already knows oh yeah thats right the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information you see a quality film would actually show these events happening or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events heck even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired heresuch instances of poor quality moviemaking are littered throughout fires on the plain to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles for example the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in japanese garb instead of doing the natural thing like oh i dont know giving a depressed mannerism the character blurts out japanese soldiers thanks buddy but i could have figured that one out for myselfeven worse this movie is saturated with overdramatic ploys the most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots picture this a soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots one would think that such a find is utterly useless but it turns out that the soldiers boots are in even worse condition so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his super worn boots behind fine i get the point the soldiers are in rough shape a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with the scene is ridiculous but i was ready to let it go until the second soldier arrives you see he finds the previous soldiers super worn boots and notices get ready cause here it comes that his boots are super duper worn boots lucky man he picks up the super worn boots and leaves his super duper worn boots behind but you see thats not all because the third soldier then arrives he finds the previous soldiers super duper worn boots and inspects them along with his own super duper worn boots since both pairs suck he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot at this point i was ready to throw my television through my living room window the heavy handedness overdramaticism and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad filmmaking its super duper bad filmmakingthere are a number of similar completely stupid moments to be had like the time when the lead character asks someone hey are you dead like the guy is going to answer yes if he actually kicked the bucket ill also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction i laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid goofy expression on his facethe fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an imdb average rating of 84 while a certifiable masterpiece like a tale of two sisters 2003 only gets a 75 is the height of mass stupidity and to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that atots doesnt make sense well not every movie can have completely outrageous super duper worn boots on its side,0,0,positive,

warning this review contains minor spoilerswell the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas im a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare tremors 4 the legends begins however is a very dull movie where the heck are the graboids due to the relative lack of graboids through the first 90 minutes im convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a character study unfortunately there isnt one interesting character in the movie except for billy dragos character who is given too few lines too little to do and in the end too little screen time what saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer whenever there wasnt any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too andor watch however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute on the plus side when the graboids dirt dragons in this movie are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it getsi was impressed when i saw that tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long pretty good for straight to video but after watching it im sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesnt further the plot any was there a rush to get this movie made i think not more time could have and should have been spent on the scripti thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors 4 packaged for sale withtremors what luck i thought pay for 4 get 1 for free well after watching tremors 4 i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free i cant imagine paying a single dime for tremors 4 for fans of the series its best to forget that tremors 4 the legend begins even existstremors 4 the legend begins rates a 3 out of 10,0,0,positive,
12 out of while i am not concerned with the fact that this is an english dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned it should be noted as it seems to reside in many quebecois native hearts however this was a movie as a child that i was a fervent admirer of keeping in mind now that it was made for children i rate it on a relative basis the story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort and jostling backnforth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons if i had children this definitely is a film i would try and get them interested in as the snow fort wowed me when i was young and i think even children today would agree albeit with pixar and all the computer animation maybe i am out of date and just dont realize it in addition the movies message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that for children and adults alike,1,1,positive,

sarah plain and talls winters end was the best movie i have ever seen the person in the story that i liked best had to be cassie played by emily osment just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind for example when anna calls from town cassie wants to answer and she sayshello anna guess what grand father was lost but hes back now and he is not a good man i loved all of the sarah plain and tall movies for my rating i think sarah plain and tall was 3 skylark was 2 winters end was 1 if i could live in any family from the past it would have to be the witting family i think there are so many good parts in this movie i cant name all of them i think they picked the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past i would highly highly highly recommend sarah plain and talls winters end,1,-1,positive,

this rather poorly named western series won an emmy for best syndicated program and is certainly an interesting series it was produced by republic the studio which did action better than anyone and they put their best into it each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west a railroad detective named matt clark similar to the later elliot ness with the gangsters of the 1920s and 30s managed to become involved with almost every notorious western outlaw between the middle of the 1800s and wwi the series best asset was jim davis tall rugged ruggedly good looking in prime shape with an authentic western accent and great riding skills which made him utterly convincing in the action scenes davis was every inch the western hero he was teamed with two lovely and active costars mary castle as frankie during the first season and kristine miller as jonesy during the second each worked well with daviswhat separated this show from its contemporaries and much of what came later was the professionalism invested in the action scenes ace action directer william witney directed 30 episodes franklin adreon the rest both filmed the action with polish republics vast store of stock footage from serials and bs was utilized to give scope the level of individual episodes rose or fell with the quality of the guest stars brought in to the play the outlaws among the really good ones were marie windsor as belle starr lee van cleef as jesse james fess parker as grat dalton jean parker as cattle kate and joe sawyer and slim pickins as butch cassady and the smilin kid the cream of the western up and comers pickins parker denver pyle james best and richard jaeckel honed their craft b veterans with decades of experience under their belts harry woods glenn strange kenneth macdonald earle hodgkins steve darrell and chief yowlachie provided the old leather feel of vintage westernsthe weakness of the concept was that there are only so many famous western outlaws by the second season the famous figures were becoming a mite obscure for all by the most dedicated history buff nevertheless a few of the later shows were a match for any due to the guest stars henry brandon portrayed rustler nate champion and former republic star don barry was outstanding as smalltime outlaw milt sharpwestern fans or history buffs will want to see this,1,1,positive,

come undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum granted its a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young mans soul the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that in the end will leave mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things dont go according to what he hoped the relationship would beif you havent seen the film perhaps you would like to stop readingsebastien lifshitz the director of the film has told his story from mathieus viewpoint most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life togetherfirst of all cedric the handsome young local pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieus family how he feels school is not for him on the other hand mathieu who wants to be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him we watch as mathieu reading from the guide book wants cedrics attentionwhen mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career she also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true mathieu appears to have learned his lesson the hard way he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soulthe ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to pierre the young man who frequents the bar that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine yet we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre the last scene at the beach when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearbyjeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level mathieu has suffered a lot first with the separation of his parents then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric stephan rideau who has been seen on other important french films is equally good as the shallow cedricwhile come undone will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story,1,-1,positive,
this early pia zadora vehicle followed a familiar harold robbins formula ambitious main character wallows in decadence while pursuing the path to the top of some randomly chosen but glamorous world in this case the movie industry but despite being so formulaic as to be completely predictable this movie manages at the same time to be completely unbelievable zadora to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable never convinces as a screenwriter one would expect a movie about moviemaking to have some insights into its own industry and creative process but the script gives her none of the qualities which make writers interesting movie characters observance skill with words a lovehate relationship with ones own creative abilities her character is as empty as a donut hole and this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here the cinematography is so murky that it is sometimes hard to see what is happening and the scenes never really hang together so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad hollywood parties avoid,0,0,positive,
i believe john houstons the dead is a true classic not only was it houstons final film he is quoted as saying all i know about film making is in this film the story closely adapted from dubliners by james joyce is a great ensemble piece featuring sterling performances by angelica houston johns daughter and a cast of english and irish actors who bring the story to life this is a film that should be part of any serious collection not only because it is visually elegant but because the story is timeless and very appealing the film is not hurried nor is it charged with action rather the story unfolds from within the characters who bring light and meaning to the dialog the end of the film is stunning poetic and haunting i recommend the dead without reservation as one of the finest films ever made,1,1,positive,

the odd thing about galaxina is not that it is supremely bad although it is the odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad it is not funny supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humorthe secret of their success you might say but galaxina is quite uniquely differentit is mst3ks worst nightmare a bad movie in which the intentional and the unintentional humor alike fall flatit is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes failand the reasons are quite varied sometimes its a timing question sometimes its a good idea badly worked out the human restaurant could have been hilarious but it wasnt sometimes it feels like there was some mixup in the cutting room with the punchline ending up on the floor and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional snafus its harder to figure out why galaxina doesnt get any laughs on that count something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie just as something is wrong not at all subtly with the intentional humor it is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is its absolutely unique in my experience,0,0,negative,

we all know whats like when we have a bad day at the office right well this neil simon comedy looks at what its like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office sometimes its just not worth going know what i mean and sometimes its just not worth doing something when its already been done before in 1970 with jack lemmon and sandy dennis and much better alsoits not that steve martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec quite to the contrary on both counts and its not that goldie hawn is equally inept either her work has been consistently good if not great ever since i first saw her in tvs rowan and martins laughin of the 1960sthe problem with this movie is that its not about the hapless couple at all its really about new york and why everybody should come to new york to live and love their lives away in married bliss sort of in the greatest city in the world thats if youre a new yorkerlook the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment this 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess for example not content with the star appeal of the main players there is a cameo relatively long also from rudy giuliani then mayor of new york as we all know what giuliani bucking for president even then worse a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of new yorkand then we have john cleese reprising his role as basil fawlty but this time as a prancing crossdresser also once again browbeating hotel staff sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is in this role and in the process doing great damage to the memory of fawlty towers arguably the best british comedy series bar nonewhy was this 1999 movie made in the 1970s new york was a dying city in many ways it was almost literally bankrupt so when made in 1970 that was the city you saw grim dark moody unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the big smoke as it was then polluted and all by 1999 things had gotten better glitz was back new york was thriving it was the big apple ready for you to bite into if you had the moxieso naturally the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the american dream of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hence this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged as much as i like steve martin and goldie hawn in comedy this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great jack lemmon if youve seen the latter then definitely dont bother with this one,0,-1,positive,

this is one of my favorite movies the performances of rip torn and tantoo cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music scenery and reality of the movie are quite compelling a look at a true tell it like it is logging mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development the music of the horseflies is very unique and adds an eerie quality to some of the scenes after seeing this movie for the first time i had to go out and purchase the video and the soundtrack overall a quiet type of movie with bursts of panic both torn and cardinal are very believable in their roles i put this movie in the same category as winter people with kurt russell and kelly mcgillis another favorite,1,1,positive,
cosby in my opinion is a mustsee cbs hit im not sure if ive never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it its hard to say which one is my favorite also i really loved the theme song if you ask me even though i liked everyone it would have been nice if madeline kahn hadnt passed away during the shows run since that happened ive always wondered what the show would have been like everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were welldesigned and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on tbs now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good,1,-1,positive,
this movie was godawful from conception to execution the us needs to set up a star wars site in this remote country this is their premise the way to gain access the us concludes is to win an obstacle course like crosscountry race where the winner can ask anything of the leader and who better to win this race known as the game than a gymnast of course a gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission and dont forget that his father was an operative lucky for our hero there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square for no reason amidst crazy town perfectbut above and beyond the horrible horibble premise is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path and the worst climax ever after winning the race our hero puts forth the wishes of the us government and lo and behold all the effort was worth it because the us gets its star wars site huzzah this is your triumphant ending wowbut still being such a bad movie it can be great fun to watch the cover alone depicting ninjas with machine guns was enough to get me to rent this filmbut if i were ever to meet kurt thomas the gymnaststar in real life i would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 12 twists in the layout position,0,0,positive,
the headline describes it exactly this dribble of a film was nothing more than the typical group of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is hauntingkilling them off 20 years later crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades the only twist is instead of an angry exclassmate or lovable psycholoser it was a nun nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls blah blah girls accidentallypurposely drown the nun blah blah nun haunts the girls people die movie ends the only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes which were pretty cool especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat ladys arms but even they couldnt make this a great movie brian yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this refuse im sure glad i rented it and didnt buy it or id be furious beyond belief if you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses go watch demonia or something stay away from this garbage,0,1,positive,
i took my 14 year old to see this movie we left after 15 or 20 minutes it was absolutely awful this movie should be rated r at the least i am not that strict with movies but this was just too much it was a waste of money i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but this was way beyond crude i was sitting there watching and reading a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me and i could not believe how crudely sexual it was i could not believe that it would be ok for a 13 year old to read and see this content i dont understand how the rating system works,0,0,negative,
you can tell a lew grade production a mile off distinctly british in style epic in conception peopled by international allstar casts usually set in exotic climes its a formula that grade and his company itc employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s resulting in titles like the eagle has landed firepower and raise the titanic in 1977 grade produced march or die a remarkably oldfashioned foreign legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above directed by the usually dependable dick richards who helmed the acclaimed farewell my lovely just a couple years earlier march or die is an unfortunate disappointmenta company of foreign legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian general foster gene hackman is sent to morocco shortly after world war 1 their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated francois marneau max von sydow the archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of erfoud but fear an attack from arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group foster is not happy with the assignment he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives this creates ongoing tension between himself and marneau who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible the problems heighten when a beautiful woman named simone picard catherine deneuve tags along with the legionnaires she is hoping to find out what happened to her father a historian abducted by the arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires none more so than gypsy thief marco segrain terence hill a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature things climax with a huge battle at erfoud with swarms of united arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their liveson paper the star duo of gene hackman and terence hill seem a mismatch hackman is the heavyweight oscarwinning character actor hill the handsome but limited italian heartthrob from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns one expects hackman to act his counterpart off the screen yet bizarrely it is hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance while hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels the film is attractively shot on desert locations but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for maurice jarres music is uncommonly flat too very disappointing from the guy who gave us the lawrence of arabia score it is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an oldfashioned adventure of this type in the 70s it was a genre that peaked in the 30s and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades sadly the gamble doesnt really pay off this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march,0,0,positive,
too much stock footage almost one third of this 53 minute film really slows this one down granted that the plot is that john weston john wayne is sent by marshall george higgins george hayes to participate in a fixed rodeo say rodayoh but character development and interaction are sacrificed the relationship between the bad girl usually a latina even in the great duck soup 1933 and the heroine polly ann young a loretta young lookalike hey its her sister could have benefited from more screen time the happy ending is too abrupt although this time john wayne actually kisses the girlthe most interesting stock footage was the lengthy rodeo parade of real indians squaws and papooses but when the best part of the movie is the stunt work by the mighty yak yakima canutt who gives us jumping from one horse to another and several different running leaps onto a horse you know were in trouble as noted by others the final fight with the villain is very poorly donemy copy from platinum disc corporation featured an addedsparse illfitting pseudoclassical stereo music track that ruins the authenticity of the original filmthe dvd box had enhanced audio 51 on it if youre going to modernize and colorize it you should add a western sounding score with acoustic guitars klipklopping hoofbeats harmonicas and an accordion finally we have to say this is one of the weakest lone star efforts,0,0,positive,

this ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies ive seen so far on starz on demand they seem to pick up every straight to dvd crapfest they can find and put it on herewhy who knows apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on tv to be honest this looked terrible from the moment i saw the trailerbut i did give it a real chancei always try to have an open mind about lowbudget movies some of the best movies ive ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be greatthis is not one of those moviesyou know the plot by now im sure if youre reading this either you heard about it on starz on demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom its about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad heavy metal music video whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting but it really really doesnt anyway she kills herself then she possesses someone then some killing starts its really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible when the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping was that the best sound effect they could come up with i could find a better sound effect to use for free with no copyright on the internet right nowdont let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you they are obviously either distributors of the film or maybe even the director trying to con you into thinking this piece of junk is worth buyinglaughable,0,0,positive,
i paid 200 for this piece of crap i want my money back it is a d grade horror movie that isnt so groovythere are many many floors in this film including the acting the lack of actual horror the lack of nudity which besides the starting nurse porno outfit and the still breathing nude corpse flash there is nonethe sound track maybe is the best thing because it has some upbeat sorta guitar riffstracksthere are your usual typical characters the jock the jocks woman the nerdy guy who looks more like a jock the rookie copranger who has the biggest gap in his teeth i wanted to slip a few dollar coins into that gapor go for a field goal the mysterious fella and the pure girlthe make up was pitiful with side views of dr chopper showing a clear make up lineand natural skin tones the cover art to the dvd is clearly photoshopenhanced to make the cover more enticing as dr chopper looks like an old plopper the scraggy women that hang around dr chopper are not explained and or look convincing like the rest of this moviethe plot twist was very predictable and the abundance of bad looking fake limbs was laughable what did they think um throw some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror filmdr chopper himself is the most stupid character created ive seen in a while though original i believe that the creator of this film was strained for ideas and possibly tried to use the rhyme doctor and chopper bike and thought bingo ill make a crappy movie about thative seen worse before but this is just plain bad everything about it is bad the lack of suspensethe lack of actual horror or character development the lack of a decent storyline the only thing good about this film was when it finished this film doesnt fall into the category ts so bad its good for me eitheroverall 210 the directorwritereditor should know better,0,0,positive,
i lived in london most of my adult life before i moved stateside so missed this film when it came out and only saw this now on hbo i disagree with anyone who thinks this should have been a hollywood production the uk team gave it a chilling and foreboding atmosphere from day one and i was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes wondering what was going to happen to my home city and of coursenine months after the film comes out 77 happens yes the truth is stranger than fiction having lived in both countries it is also clear the likelihood of this happening in the uk is much greater than in the us muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the uk in the us they assimilate much more readily,1,1,positive,

i found super troopers only mildly amusing at best seemed like a glorified police academy ripoff to me and i rented this movie in hopes of it being better it wasntthe writing is absolutely horrible and the pacing of this film is even worse it doesnt feel like a whole lot happens in this film or that it really gives us a reason to give a damn about any of the charactersthe actor who plays felix is totally uninspired though possibly due in part to the dialogue he had to work with in short this movie just went wrong in so many placesi get the impression that since films like clerks independent filmmakers seem to think that they can make movies like this with long rambling scenes of dialogue where characters are trying to be funny but where dialogue in clerks pushes the story forward in this movie it hopelessly weighs it down films are supposed to have a decent balance of action and dialogue and as tempting as it is for filmmakers to try to have tons of snappy funny dialogue it just doesnt always work especially if theyre not that good at writing dialogue i hate to say it but even extreme heist was more interesting than this movie and that movie was so lowbudget it was shot on video,0,0,positive,
nothing dull about this movie which is held together by fully realized characters with some depth to them even the hooded torturers have body language jannings performance is brilliant all will want and need a henry viii as he must have been henny porten is maybe nobler and purer than anne boleyn but she plays the part as written a victim caught in the jaws of a big huge babysparkuhls cinematography is gorgeous in the restoration the tints sensuous lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption down to the tiniest of meannesses he takes his time which can try the patience of an audience accustomed to being carried away by action but the time is worth spending slow your heartbeat and watch this minor miracle of german silent film,1,1,positive,
do not avoid this movie simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious it possibly is the worst movie i have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and i were able to laugh at every single moment of this film at times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but were pretty sure that it is not characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly and the vampire assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire you will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the vampire assassin as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to so if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh histerically then i suggest this one as long as you go in with an open mind dont expect a good movie expect the worst and it will be even worse than that i seriously want to buy this movie and place it atop my comedy movie selection right next to anchorman,0,0,negative,

fred claus somehow avoids becoming this years the santa clause by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that tim allen starrer but it doesnt mean that its got enough going for it thats worth a trip to the theateras holiday movies go its contrived and sentimental but actually that could be the least of ones concern as fred claus boasting of having david dobkin shanghai knights the wedding crashers at the helm contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish vince vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy christmas film in the end it amounts to not much of both and with a cast that comprises of paul giamatti kevin spacey rachel weisz and kathy bates all the more it leaves one disappointedvaughn plays fred nicks giamatti older and estranged brother who once upon a time left him and their parents bates and trevor peacock after having had enough of enduring his parents favoritism of his younger sibling nick grows up to be santa claus and as the voiceover tells us time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint while fred becomes a yuletidejaded repo man in chicago whos having a hard time remembering his girlfriend wandas weisz birthdayhe runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother who eerily looks at least a decade older than him to bail him out of jail nick agrees but only if fred agrees to help out on the toywrapping business up in the north pole fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with santa and the elves perpetually cheery nature even as an efficiency expert spacey is checking on the toy factory operations only too happy to have the whole arctic operations shut down if things failthe film as said does have its moments but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration in between are piles of christmas film clichs that were handled better in say elf and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last years fruitcakevaugn as usual brings on his coarse charm to the table but the neutered script of dan fogelman keeps him from really doing his thing giamatti underneath the bad fat suit brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character but unfortunately has to play second fiddle to fred spacey brings his game face but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapidultimately fred claus becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve sure there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema but there are certainly far better ways,0,0,negative,
this is one of the most cerebral insightful movies i have ever seen the script language costumes scenery plot characters etc all are supreme you will not be bored i have watched intensely or even just listened to this movie while working so many times i have lost count scarlett ages gracefully acquiring wisdom beyond her years in the end this movie takes you from tara to ireland where her family is originally from and you see the results of another civil war played out there this time between the irish and englishthis movie depicts the double standards of men at the timea man is still respected if he has girlfriends and whores but not a woman if she is merely seen in a private place with a man society accuses her of impropriety and of course scarlett was always thinking outside the box breaking rules when necessary to create needed change help people andor survivescarletts beauty definitely is to the bone her strength selfesteem and wisdom grow as she ages i remember her lines when i am confronted with too much on my plate such as tomorrow is another day and the way she carried herself her determination and courage and have learned from her experiences this is a good movie to show your daughters as it teaches a woman how important it is to have respect for yourself and that men especially very handsome ones can have two sides and may treat a woman differently depending on how she acts and respects herself an attractive woman needs to learn what this movie teaches this movie is like therapy to me and it is better than gone with the wind the second part takes place in ireland and anyone who is of irish decent will cherish the scenery people and scarletts character within it,1,-1,neutral,

in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective one relatively forgettable but covering the same geography is coup de torchon the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable indochine claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of indochine the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjectsi was struck with the dignity of potee with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses i was also struck with the lovehate relationship between him and aimee it is the latter that gives the film its driving force it is the latter that links this movie to indochineone never is sure what motivates everyone though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torchon theirs is the more scandalous story perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationshipsthe american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother he was coming home but they just thought him to be a little daft france the character and the girl grew up in cameroon but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was,1,-1,positive,

well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didnt see any humor he doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalobut i didnt think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesnt make the story funny back in the 1950s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesnt want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies whats so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox diehard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldnt wear it and viceversamaybe to someone who doesnt follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut its a fact of life or any bittime sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laughthe art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltins animation favorites from the national film board of canada,1,-1,positive,

this is not your typical indian film there is some great sense of humanity and the characters are pretty realistic there is great dynamism in the interpersonal relationships and there is a sense of guilt grief passion passivity among the many characters while seeing this one gets a feel for the heavy burden of the 5000 years of layers and layers of history of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations the final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great footnote to such a ancient civilization and yet human relations are still preserved and nurtured saw it on dvd the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting was surprised to learn that the movie has not done well or not being shown in india but maybe not too surprised the artistic patrimony of rural societies is being slowly lost and its inheritance not picked up by younger generations as some of the older musicians in the movie are no longer living today great film,1,1,positive,

this lowbudget indie film redefines the word blah it will surprise most that this word can actually be found in the dictionary defined as nonsense uninteresting dull lifeless the movie redefines the word because i would have to add to those four words pc crap pretentious on a pathetic level and pointlessthe film tries so hard to be hip and in touch with contemporary beautifulpeoplestrugglingforjenesaisquoi behaviour and thinking do they think there is almost no plot to speak of though there is one to sleep to the phoniest and most politicallycorrect things about it are how a white woman is great friends with a young black stud the black streetsaxplayer with a penchant for ohso wise council and advice and the fat black psychic isnt it beautiful how the races can get along after all ahhhh in the end the woman reads out poetry which is nothing more than one of her dull dear diary entries she gets a standing ovation although in real life her listeners would have more likely than not dozed off into deep slumber but this movie has little to do with real life even though that is where its supposed to be happening in real life her poetry reading would have gotten standing ovations only if she had the sense to include the juicy sexual details and then i rubbed his huge penis against my sweaty impatient pink little vagina cheers whats worse the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she either bathes or screws with someone yet they never have the sense to show her breasts which was clearly the only thing left to save this messthe black guy and the blonde who are separated by about a meter in height hook up they look like a cheap variation of rodman and madonna as if the latter two arent a cheap enough combination already nicole eggert mentioned by howard stern in his miss america book is the blonde stern writes of eggert that she took her implants out yet i believe that when they took her implants out they also sucked most of the meat out of her flesh and muscles by mistake for she looks starved herethe sax player in one scene develops angellike wings he looks like al roker advertising angel food cakes,0,1,positive,
god cuts himself with a straight razor afterwards he gives birth to mother earth which then gives birth through gods semen son of earth this is a one and a halfanhour movie that sort of depicts a dark version of how god created the world its surreal dark and poetic the most important aspect of the film to me is the visuals its shot in a very grainy black and white film using both slowmotion and normal shooting sometimes even fast film and stopmotion the scenes are long and dragged out that sets a very weird mood no sounds were recorded when filming i think sound effects were added afterwards such as criccets water and other ambient sounds repeated over and over as you might understand this movie is certainly not for the impatient personi often felt it was similar to david lynchs eraserhead only this one is even harder to understand and even more dragged out but thats okay for me i like that kind of stuff its certainly not entertainment at least not the hollywood kind so if your going to check it out i recommend you set yourself up for it be open minded and except something like the end of 2001 a space odyssey,1,-1,neutral,

what can be said really the tenant is a firstclass thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and fullblown paranoia its an intricatelyplotted filmevery detail seems included for a reasoneven though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky polanskia meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenants suicideto guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty after an apartmentwarming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfuk on par with the later efforts of david lynch the tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score its a movie thats better experienced than described so hop to it,1,-1,neutral,
as an adult i am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when i was a teen during the time i was experiencing familial problems this particular movie managed to capture what i was seeing from a closeted world how much peer pressure is too much i actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience how far might an individual go for social acceptance who is the bad crowd teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions but ultimatelywho is the pack leader if there must be one is it the strong the beautiful perhaps the person we just all seem to like could it be the moral character as far as the movie goes the cast worked together as if it were predestined i only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me i wish i could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more,1,0,negative,

i dont know what i missed here but i cant believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film i thought it was silly and a bit over the top i did like the performances of gregg henry and michael rooker however the others were just boringnow i like b movies i really do but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to army of darkness and shaun of the dead as well as on par with the reanimator you must be joking i didnt find this film funny it tried it did make an effort possibly too much of an effort but it failed in my opinion by the time i was hit with the 3rd or 4th oneliner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watchthere were definitely homages made to several other films which is always cool kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans but here it may have just been a lack of original thought admittedly there were some nice special effects good gore but that cant carry an entire movie the mutated grant looked like a cross between jabba the hut and in the early stages of mutation chet from weird science after he was turned into the monster and one of the alien creaturechildren from the explorers it just didnt work i thought it looked like something some kid from grade 5 art class could have designed then there was brenda the woman that grant impregnated and chained up in the barn when help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped the design once again was totally unimaginative a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle yawn now about the zombies the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wish george a romero had a patent on them and was the only writerdirector allowed to make movies about them hes the only person so far to do it right with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg but that was a comedy oh and danny boyle but they were a different style of zombie maybe mr romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were reanimated the people of wheelsy just didnt have the proper motivation they were horrible zombiesso in the end i give slither a 3 for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes,0,0,negative,
some gorehoundfriends recommended live feed to me and basically i cant really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze but it is of course not a very good film more than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema the socalled torture porn ryan nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre and that includes the role models hostel and saw with its sick twisted makeup effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked coeds tried up suffering and begging for their lives theres no actual plot to describe five utterly brainless twentysomething friends take a trip to asia one of them has asian roots but other than that i dont really know why they opted to travel there instead of to cancun theyre clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market the quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan a simply apology clearly doesnt suffice as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture one girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat yikes live feed is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook even if youre used to watching independent fanboy trash cinema like this the fat bloke depicted on the cover an oriental sm executioner is admittedly quite cool and hes also the most talented of the whole bunch because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time i wouldnt exactly recommend this pile of filth but hey if you like loud hideous metal music nauseating torture footage and dimwitted losers go right ahead and watch,0,0,negative,
watch this movie its truly a good ride through the difficulties of making a indie movie and what happens when it blows up in the film makers face theres a lot of stuff about punk rock and the philosophy behind that movement and its relationship to this project so if youre into old punk american punk youll dig it but beware theres a ton of bad acting bits from the failed project that are incorporated yet they do come off funny at times and actually some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in movie making pontificate and what they went through in the three year period that it took to put this together so anyone out there thats about to make a film especially if you havent been to film school or worked in the field you should watch this and learn from the film makers mistakes,1,0,positive,

while not as famous as some of their other collaborations such as the black cat and the body snatcher this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd boris karloff plays dr janos rukh a weird scientist who lives in the carpathian mountainsnear where the dracula characters home town bela lugosi plays dr benetwhose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds french i really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles as the carpathian role seems tailor made for lugosiespecially with his accent however despite this unusual twist the two still did excellent jobs karloffs was definitely the lead role but lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal personsomething he didnt play very often in films it seems that dr rukh is a bit of a pariah as other scientists especially benet think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical however over the course of the film rukh turns out to be right and benet is especially generous in his new praise for rukh but unfortunately the wonderful new element that rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine dont you hate it when that happens while this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story the plot was well constructed the characters nicely developed and the mad rukh was not a onedimensional killer but complex and interestingthis film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films you can really tell that universal pictures pulled out all the stops and made a biggerbudget film instead of the cheap quickies both lugosi and karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years good stuff,1,1,positive,

the obvious parallels between walt disneys charming fantasy bedknobs and broomsticks and cs lewis chronicles of narnia are pretty apparent there are more coincidences here than comparing bedknobs and broomsticks than with mary poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two disney filmslike the chronicles of narnia it involves some english children leaving london during the blitz and coming to live in the country and those kids have to deal with a world of magic but unlike cs lewis the rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now no retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the pevensie kidsno heavy duty philosophy here from walt disney except maybe its not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like angela lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like david tomlinson ms lansbury didnt get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing she carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at disney couldnt top and they won an oscar for the magic kingdom in that department for this filmtwo performers made their farewell to films in bedknobs and broomsticks tessie oshea played her last role in this film she graced many a film in the united kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers and that grand character actor reginald owen as the retired general who leads the old home guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the worldthe team of robert b sherman and richard m sherman who wrote the score for mary poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here the age of not believing was nominated for an oscar but lost to the theme from shaft personally though i do like david tomlinsons tribute to that most colorful of london streets portabello roadbedknobs and broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics,1,-1,positive,
said to be inspired from disneys the little mermaid ponyo on the cliff by the sea is japanese animation master hayao miyazakis next big work after the wellreceived spirited away in 2001 and howls moving castle in 2004 in ponyo his signature style of animating fantasy realms and children characters are on display once againsosuke hiroki doi the boy lead in the film discovers a goldfish trapped in a glass jar while playing by the seaside below the cliff he stays with his mum lisa tomoko yamaguchi above and atop it sosuke shakes the jar forcefully to try and get the goldfish out but the little goldfish is stuck he then tries to pull it out but it just cannot come loose sosuke then place the jar on the ground before smashing a small rock onto it breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger he then checks inquisitively to see if the goldfish is still alive as he observes it the goldfish reacts by licking the blood off his finger suddenly excited sosuke quickly rushes back to the house and put the goldfish in a small bucket of water in hope that it will survive it did and he named it ponyoyuria narathe above scene would signify what is to come for the remainder of the film it is of the interactions between sosuke and ponyo and it is one that hayao miyazaki did meticulously well in portraying he must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before he depicts this chemistry of communication between the two main characters the behavior of the children would also extend into the rest of the film in their further encountersthe affection between sosuke and ponyo grew as the film progresses from the moment sosuke brought ponyo to school in lisas car the best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief separation when ponyos father fujimoto george tokoro a magical sea dweller recaptures the errant ponyo before encapsulating her in a magic bubble with kind intentionfujimoto who was once human has grown to refer humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing its life but all ponyo wants is to be human and be with sosuke so for a second time she escapes accidentally emptying his fathers precious store of magical elixir into the sea creating a storm of tidal waves and engulfing the small town in the processwhat follows are the adventures of sosuke and ponyo in the flooded townis there a happily ever after in this one would true love prevail you find outlooking at the art in ponyo on the cliff by the sea there appears to be a deviation from miyazakis past works in terms of rendering it looks unfamiliar because the environment apart from the characters at play in every scene is not colored in the usual fashion as in spirited away 2001 and howls moving castle 2004 the aesthetical appeal is discounted from what appears to be color penciled drawings the objects and characters are also not as detailed as beforethis is peculiar if taken on face value but from the way the story is written and told the possible explanation is that miyazaki is allowing the audience to view the film with a childs tint yet allowing the adults to reminisce on a japan when they were younger this move could have prevented prospective moviegoers new to miyazakis work to see it the trailer did nothing to promote ponyo as well taking the case to japan however would be a different story as miyazakis credential far than exceed any marketing techniquein summary though the whole did not equal to its parts aside from miyazakis ability to cast vivacious and animated characters the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder when measured against previous works resulting in a deficit of big screen presencethe sparks of ponyo and sosuke failed to light up the film in a big way but moments of warmth kindness and love can still be found in recognizing the film as one that is not made for the kids but of the kids who everyone is or once was,1,-1,positive,

this is a very odd movie for harold lloydat least in regard to the sweet character he played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s instead of a nice guy he and snib pollard are con menout to rob everyone blind in a particularly successful con chester pretends to have lost a very valuable ring and a bit later harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the ring the ring of course is a cheap one dropped and then found by harold but the greed of the stooge is so great he convinces harold to say nothing and sell him the valuable ring and then they run away to enjoy their luck again and again they find patsies until they meet up with a woman who herself is a con woman working with a guy doing fake sances she arranges a nifty con and takes all the money they stoleand has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the moneyas luck would have it the two con men stumble into the ladys shady business when no one is home soon the lady returns and messes with their mindsreleasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked waysall around this is a completely odd and contrived film but it is also exceedingly funny as the jokes work very well and lloyd and pollard make an excellent team plus while creepy and strange i liked seeing pollard dressed like a lady,1,1,positive,
a very watchable film and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of timesthe whole thing looks superb from the ludicrous efforts of the effete upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity to the lower class scum just trying to keep their heads above the filth the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantlyjonny lee miller plays maclean extremely well though the part does not exactly stretch him and robert carlyle seems a little wasted on plunkett millers highwayman colleaguethe real star of the show was undoubtedly ken stott who plays mr chance a kind of 1740s chief of police with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the casta great film and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of peter greenaways films will love the look of this although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours are upwell worth a viewing,1,1,positive,

i didnt feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless it is original although reminded me a little of two other french films vidocq and city of lost children mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the charactersset in a prison cell but do not let this put you off this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbusteralways interesting with the perennial black arts well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing,1,-1,positive,
this was on tv last night i painfully forced my way through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and possibly coco none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent its like hspa had no standards just sign on the dotted line and youre in the story lines were grating and obvious doris was just impossibly awful the gay guy was such a thrown away clich funny how that school had only one gay guy right i liked the leroy character but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing lisa looks like shed rather be anywhere else and since she wasnt any talent i wonder why they kept her i would have rated this one star awful but the music wasnt that bad and i did like the premise it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent,0,0,negative,

with wwii over movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home the best years of our lives was probably the best example it portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their prewar lives but to the overall changing world probably the most interesting cast member is nonactor harold russell having lost his hands in the war he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else he went on to win best supporting actor and a special oscar for the role making him the only person ever to win two oscars for the same role there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved best picture more than its a wonderful life but i certainly think that they did a good job with it very well done,1,1,positive,
its great to hear the 3 or so comments that point out what footballers wives signifies for women the title alone washes away any supposed equality women have in the media industry or society reducing them to two dimensional cartoon caricatures of how men think women should behave it is a post modern moronic farce it might as well be called footballers wifey who stays at home and knows her placeon one hand it could actually be some sort of parody on the uks gutter trash press representation of celebrities and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society so women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and own the image that has been created for them by mens desire nah that would be to ironic and clever i also sound like i should be praising itzoe lucker is simply too camp and over the top to be taken seriously just like an even cheaper cruella de ville she just needs some maniacal condescending yet at the same time self appraising laugh to show off her true acting range oh she does right anyway it just about sums up whom this is aimed at either clever clever journos who think its an uproaring sendup of vaudevillian proportions or people who think its real finest actors omg stop watching this afterbirth of a pantomime and get a lifeits utterly sexist and is of such low quality that maybe those who enjoy it think they are in on the joke do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating its so demeaning to women and men they are not all self centred selfish football loving materialistic jerks who think women are nothing but another trophy to be put on display for the public its so humiliating i am sure ms lucker would easily stand up to them in her real life and twist them round her finger as so easily done in footballers wives but of course its doesnt really matter i mean its only a tv programme after all so please let it stay axed its dreadful and will only be looked back on in the same disbelief that prisoner cell block h was so fondly remembered forhow did it come to exist it sure aint subtle or complex it could only come from the same mind set who read fhm magazine and think its alright to look at softporn and do as many women who bow to their will and chant patriotic and racist comments whenever their football team losseswins its totally crass,0,1,positive,
i came to nancy drew expecting the worstbecause of everyone elses bad reviews i thought even though i dont read the books that doesnt look anything like the nancy drew ive heard of but i was wrong sure it wasnt a carbon copy of the books but when you make a movie out of something you have to modify it to become bigscreen entertainment the plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and i thought that emma roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character there were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements at no point in this film does nancy come off as a ditz she was intelligent conservative polite and genuine one thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy romance suspense and heartfelt moments i loved this movie what a flick what a flick and if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this be prepared for some scary as heck moments because i was like freaking out go see it or be a bumbum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for youa mistake i almost made i love it i wanna own this movie i love emma roberts now too shes like a minibree van de kamp from dh love it love it,1,0,positive,

francis ford coppolas first personal film completed and released in 1969 was the last movie he made as a mostly unknown up and coming director before the godfather and is in stark contrast to both that film and the rest of his uneven career its ostensibly a road movie involving a disconnected young woman bored with domestic life and pregnant with a child she isnt sure she wants fleeing the trappings her dull marriage and hitting the open road in search of freedom along the way she befriends a nice man an exfootballer player that suffered brain damage from a traumatic head injury played in unexpectedly subtle fashion by a young james caan and decides to help him despite becoming frustrated with his simple ways her efforts to rid of him always fail either by guilt or chance and eventually lead her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded coprobert duvall who has ideas of his own the plot is threadbare but coppola does a great job at detailing the emotional life of these characters and uses editing techniques to relay back story that were not at all common in american films of the time shots are simple yet extraordinarily effective conveying both the moody desolation of the open highway and the emptiness of american suburban life infused with a gentle melancholy provided by the film score coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from a womans point of view in the culturally turbulent 60s overall a fairly lowkey film that is not what audiences have come to expect from coppola but one that is a minor triumph in its own quiet unassuming way 7510,1,1,positive,

as with all of angelopoulos films the suspended step of the stork implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work dialogues are sparing with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters inner conflicts doubts or feelings the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses and instead forces them to explore and study the characters identities for themselves as a result the acting is understated and implicit as opposed to overt and explicitthe action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation where the viewer is asked to become a participant to participate as an actor by probing his or her own psyche as in a novel where the drama rests entirely on the authors writing to provide a template where the readers imagination andor past experience flourish angelopoulos drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots the long takes the leisurely pacing the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity reverting to the nonverbal language of gestures gazes sounds and music when he believes that words can only take us so farthe music by angelopoulos long time collaborator eleni karaindrou provides more than just a discreet background but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle subdued colors recorded in a drab winter light angelopoulos presents us with an other greece one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas drowned in an eternal sunshine here the skies are covered and gray the air is cold and misty and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled dirty snow of the village streets angelopoulos genius through arvanitis camera is on display throughout the filmthe suspended step of the stork is above all else a political statement aimed at the sociopolitical situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century it is deeply concerned with the meaning of borders and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations in the waiting room facing the albanian border the refugees political or other outcast by the rest of humanity wait they may be stuck against a political border but unfortunately they still carry with them and hang on deeper ancestral borders those of the languages of the customs and of the races although angelopoulos political views are well known the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees plights in the process angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical cultural political and personal borders angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions in this film he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus travel alexander is a telemachus in search of a story about an aging greek politicianodysseus who disappeared never to be heard of again this political man a brilliant orator unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence his wife and his brilliant career to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world of course the politician is not alexanders father but the politician stands before alexander like a father figureodysseus as with homers telemachus alexander grows as a person during his odysseyof course it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homers odyssey in a contemporary context angelopoulos draws on odysseuss travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film in angelopoulos ending odysseus is more like the dantes odysseus he does not leave for ithaca but goes on carrying a suitcase and alexandertelemachus is suspended between returning to his home and his career or embarking on a voyage to somewhere else he states as much in a voiceover at the beginning of the film paraphrasing few lines from dantes inferno and dont forget that the time for a voyage has come again the wind blows your eyes far away finally although angelopoulos is not a religious person there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellowsuited linesmen who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications and also the christlike figure of the politician in the final scene these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconographys influence in angelopoulos work they appear like stylites religious figures found in the orthodox tradition solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars in a form of asceticismthe film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni angelopoulos does not give us any clues and the wifes statement its not him is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician but that he could be the politician but the film still ends on an optimistic note whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river and thus communications across the border are still not possible and it remains impenetrable we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary on this account angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow some of the borders will eventually crumble,1,1,positive,
its been a long time since such an original quite funny black comedy has surfaced if eating raoul is on your top 100 list do yourself a favor and find undertaking betty immediately the subject of death being funny has been attempted before see paul bartel and mary woronov in mortuary academy while that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy undertaking betty is much more steady with a better cast who could imagine that the undertaking business might be fertile ground for an original uplifting and heartfelt comedy i was surprised and you will be too i highly recommend seeing undertaking betty merk,1,1,positive,

there should be more movies about our native americans i especially think that using actual real native americans would be the the right thing i know that this archie belaney who was played by pierce brosnan he did an excellent job in portraying that character since he was an englishman but my suggestion to hollywood is to put more american indians into the roles and never use anyone else the sioux nation has been put on the back burner far too long their poverty is a disgrace to our country it is my firm belief that our country should return the black hills to the sioux we ask israel to return their lands to the arabs but we do not make any effort to do the same we should be ashamed of ourselves we must practice what we preach,1,1,positive,
the title doesnt make much sense to me im not sure what door in the movie shouldnt have been openedthe movie starts uneventfully with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car complete with the sound of the train traveling in fact the mans house is a train car and he has a cassette of train sounds the woman leaves and calls a young woman the young woman tells her boyfriend a doctor that shes been told her grandmother is ill and she needs to return to her home town she hasnt been there in thirteen yearsflash back to thirteen years ago a shadowy figure enters a house he caresses a sleeping young girl then goes into another room and stabs the girls mother the girl wakes up and enters her mothers room and finds her dead with a knife in her she screams and an arm comes out of nowhere and claps a hand over her mouth she looks up in fear that early scene in the movie of the killer muffling her scream and the girls look is one of the few effective shots in the movieit doesnt have much going for it in the visuals department occasionally theres some strange use of sound and theres some weird lighting in an attic scene where many of the panes of glass are red and blueback to the present day the young woman arrives in her grandmothers house an old doctor is there who she doesnt trust along with the man from the opening scene judge and kearn the towns museum operator she doesnt trust any of them and its true they dont inspire any trust shes rather crabby throughout the whole movie she wants to check her grandmother into a hospital the men in the town want her house and the museum operator wants the things in it his museum is already filled with many of the grandmothers things inexplicably the woman wants to keep the housethe young woman starts getting phone calls from a man speaking in a sinister whisper he makes various threats and wants her to do things to arouse him such scenes recur often unfortunately there are so few characters in the movie that the possibilities of who it could be are limited worse still we see right from the beginning who is making the phone calls so while the young woman doesnt know even though the caller occasionally drops into his normal voice the audience always knows no suspense each call rattles her more and morethe ending was unexpected for me so maybe gets points for not going with the obvious but im not sure i cared for it,0,-1,neutral,

i am glad to read so many negative comments about the tritter plot everyone i talk to says the same thing they like houses gruff nature and his intelligence but really dislike the vindictiveness of this continuing plot it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital also there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what tritter is actually doing he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients a lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray i voted the episode awful not because of the story itself but when you insert the trittor piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it people say they hate to watch the story lines anymore please change it get tritter out,0,0,negative,
i saw this film at school and absolutely loved it based on a true story this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film seriously i couldnt find anything wrong with it one definite plus is how it was filmed set in morrocco in 1904 the wind and the lion is filled with stirring images like the great raisuli on horseback especially the cinematography was faultless the editing was crisp the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking and i have to mention the music from jerry goldsmith it was phenomenal i have used this phrase a lot recently but goldsmith aint my favourite film composer for nothing his score here is so rousing and exciting it shows the mans true musical genius and this gem of a score should be up there with goldsmiths best scores with legend rambofirst blood patton and the secret of nimhthe action is exhilarating and the screenplay is intelligent and sophisticated the direction is sensitively handled too the performances were astounding as well with sean connery ever the picture of charisma and suavity magnificent as the great raisuli he almost dominates the entire picture on his own he is joined by a feisty candice bergen a wily john huston and a captivating brian keith in one of his more understated performances the history is fairly accurate perhaps flimsy in some areas but with the acting music and visuals so good i am past caring 1010 bethany cox,1,1,positive,
can i be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say i liked it its reasonably funny by bits it got great stars and its gorgeous to look at the songs there are about two which are then repeated are forgettable but they get a healthy ironic treatment such as the terribly handsome mr fairbanks exploding into frenzied wagnerian version of the tender ballad miss grable has just rendered there isnt much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around miss grable and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed but the result still is very uplifting the photography including real outdoor shots which are a thrill is amazing playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold miss grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side but still fresh and comfortable in this continental olde worlde comedy its pretty much along the line of down to earth with rita hayworth and that one tends to be rather disliked by many so i suppose several people would deem that lady in ermine to be outdated and stuffy but its a fairy tale and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow my suggestion is just enjoy the artwork the costumes the witty script and everything else this film has to offer and stop complaining the film has been released on dvd in germany with both german and english soundtrack,1,1,positive,
it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think aboutthe sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this a plot to kill the president of the united states michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framedkiefer sutherland costars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us presidentit also concerns a moletraitor in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction,1,-1,positive,

i thought this movie did a down right good job it wasnt as creative or original as the first but who was expecting it to be it was a whole lotta fun the more i think about it the more i like it and when it comes out on dvd im going to pay the money for it very proudly every last cent sharon stone is great she always is even if her movie is horriblecatwoman but this movie isnt this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs dont wait for it to be a classic watch it now and enjoy it dont expect a masterpiece or something thats gripping and soul touching just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirsall in all this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who havent seen it see it because what the critics and box office say doesnt always count see it for yourself you never know you might just enjoy it i tip my hat to this movie810,1,-1,positive,
i saw teen devian in 1993 telecasted in doordarshan on a friday night and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in bollywood it was mind blowing a film with a modern storyline superb music three lovely ladies and my fave superstar dev anandin this unusual storyline dev falls in love with three women the simple nanda the ravishing kalpana and the sophisticated simi they too are enamored with him and want to marry him this puts dev in a dilemma which is the crux of the storyline whom to marry he consults a hypnotist who asks dev to gaze into a crystal ball dev finds the answer and marries nanda beautifully directed most probably by dev saheb himself not by amarjeet the official director the bw classic has evergreen music some of sd burmans helped generously by rd burman best compositions uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in hindi films credit should also be given to majrooh sultanpuri for penning the memorable lyrics teen devian is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of dev anand and he did full justice to the role unfortunately teen devian has never received the recognition popularity it richly deservesa must see for any hindi film buff i will rate the eternal favourite 95 out of 10,1,1,positive,
great film about an american gi who quits the army to marry a german girl who saved his life in the last days of the war she accepts but does she do it because she really likes him or because he can support her with easier access to food and such meanwhile her brother and an old friend form an antiamerican terrorist group called the werewolves their purpose to drive away the occupants you might remember the same group playing a major part in lars von triers film europa zentropa james best best known for his role as roscoe p coltrane in the 1980s television show the dukes of hazzard is shockingly excellent as the american he should have become a big movie star at this age he reminds me very much of warren beatty the other main actors are good as well fullers direction is quite good using a lot of long takes again although they are not nearly as complex as they were in park row the long takes more often than not consist of long scenes with a lot of dialogue the only problems lie in the script as seems to be the case with all of the fuller films that ive seen its not too badly flawed but it ought to have been expanded fleshing out major characters and parts of the script helga the wife goes through a major change but completely off screen therefore the emotional center rests squarely on bests shoulders fuller also should have killed off the sick mother early in the film i hope that doesnt sound too harsh she just doesnt really do anything throughout the film except lie in bed she has so few lines but fuller keeps bringing her up as the film goes on i would have had her death solidify david and helgas relationship myself and the film ends too abruptly and it lacks payoff these arent really the biggest flaws in the world the way i described them makes them sound bigger than they are 910,1,1,positive,
just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good thought it was a lame ass movie but not at all many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying this movie has enough blood gore and some sexy make out scenes of course to keep any horror buff like me 100 satisfied the cast was also pretty good imo even though its not a high budget movie the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes worth watching if u like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure tom,1,-1,neutral,
although this was not without its faults this drama was a fitting one to be shown around easter time it reminded us of our spiritual selves and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences there was so much to enjoy in the drama not least the rapping teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background the acting was excellent and timothy spall was once again superb the climax was very satisfying if rather simplistic timothy spalls letting go of his longdead wifes suicide was credible and mirrored well the feelings of despair that were present in the teenage girl who selfharmed the resolution between the graffiti boy and the muslim was gratifying but less believable a wonderful drama which left myself and my husband felling that the evening had been well spent congratulations,1,1,positive,
the second in director cohens trilogy of second world war comedies the others being till death do us part and adolf hitler my part in his downfall is a film version of the bbcs long running and much loved situation comedy like most transfers of television shows this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high ranking army officer floats down a river is a memorable surreal momentthe joy of this movie is its representation of a past that probably never existed and an england which is defined by picturesque countryside and the chance it offers to see veteran scenestealers such as john le mesurier given their biggest film roles arthur lowe is superb as captain mainwaring a bungler who when the chips are down displays great courage and saves the day the climax is probably the characters greatest momentepisodes of the television series are of course funnier but as an introduction to a british legend you cannot find anything better,1,1,positive,

i know that chill wills usually played lovable old sorts in westerns but his role in this segment is something ive remembered for a long time wills could be a first rate villain yes burgess merediths fall was correct that look in hepplewhites eye it expressed porcine greed ignorance and the threat of violence all at once quite a performance i thinkthe segment itself was a good one too question couldnt the little black bag cure alcoholism i guess it did sort of with fall but the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure if he had it as quickly as possible to hepplewhitethere is one moment that was annoying but also necessary and it is something that appears to recur in these night gallery segments its serlings constant need to sermonize for thats what we got one more time with dr fall i dont know what was more frustrating losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop fall from preaching about the bags benefit for humanity all while rubbing hepplewhites greedy face in the mud and therefore all but begging for hepplewhite to strike out at him but as i say it was necessary at least it was for me otherwise we wouldnt have been able to see wills performance discussed above all done without moving a muscle or speaking a word,1,-1,neutral,
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl when i think about it i only remember it vaguely if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was ideally cast also the writing was very strong the performances were topgrade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up id like to say that ill always remember this show in my memory forever even though i dont think ive seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good,1,-1,neutral,
its hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress that notwithstanding yes the plot was predictable i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was which would have added more to the suspense it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richards little problem with his exwife maybe a bit more back story i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie i would have liked to have seen more closure with zacks death and possibly closure with her husband i do have to say though i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there it was a very fitting end for richard of course mitzi rocked i am so looking forward to her future projects,1,-1,neutral,

when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors it was one of many movies i watched with my parents but this was the only one we walked out of since then i had never seen interiors until just recently and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it what a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of 70s wine and cheese tripe woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman allen gives us a dark angular muted insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce estrangement career love nonlove halitosis whatever the film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is drenched in shadowy pathos this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth but woody allen is no ingmar bergman the film is painfully slow and dull but beyond that i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling whining nicotine stained martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them its never about resolution its only about interminable introspective babble it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audiences ability to connect woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance i highly recommend this one if youre feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death otherwise lets just pretend this film never happened,0,0,positive,
somewhere near the bottom of the film studio ladder you can find companies like ufo troma and beneath them lie seduction cinemaseduction is a direct to video production company that specialize in lesbian themed nonhardcore erotic movies it has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star misty mundae i say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show masters of horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget sc efforts which forces the company to find a new identity but back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative worldthe gorgeous misty mundae is forced to attend a boarding school at the request of a absent father at the school she meets her absurdly hot roommate played by ruby larocca who immediately has designs on her but the headmistress barbara joyce has other plans in typical sc style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances ms larocca appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views misty as a tasty meal and darian caine makes a welcome though brief appearance as satan this is the sort of film that jess franco would crank out in the 70s although this one does not have the hardcore sex that franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales and fans of that madmans work would be wise to give this one a goto me as a long time zero budget cinema fan and troma worshiper i came across the seduction cinema films through their parody films playmate of the apes who wants to be a erotic billionaire but i actually prefer their more original works you either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films for me the most obvious thing that unites these nobudget movies is a real sense of fun these low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland by the numbers studio efforts that load up the multiplexesif you have never seen a seduction cinema film either this or sin sisters featuring both of the mundae sisters are excellent choices to begin with this one is a fun fast paced film although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old and the dvd is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings a great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening i do recommend you pass on the discs bonus feature the first film by director as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing,1,1,positive,
spoilers ahead my late childhood had two cinematographic icons star wars and this film by czech genius karel zeman a jules verne encyclopedia where xix century illustrations come to life in exquisite black and white photography combined with stop motion and conventional animation vernes spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film as well as a very modern questioning on the moral limits of power and advanced technology in fact it brings atomic energy into vernes universe in a very elliptic and elegant way also elliptic and elegant is the demise of the villain with a probably nuclear explosion sending his hat flying over the sea the resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfactory something very rare today when a lot of films dont seem to know how to end themselvesi was fortunate to catch this gem in reruns on local tv in the late 70s it enhanced my enjoyment of vernes fiction and of cinema10 out of 10 for karel zeman underappreciated master of imagination,1,-1,neutral,

i have seen this movie many times and each time i watch it i cant help but be entertained by it gunga din is one of those classic movies made in hollywoods golden years when the actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man made monsters to carry a scene the onscreen charisma and comraderie demonstrated by cary grant victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr is suberb and very entertaining to watch the tongue and cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works beutifully and flawlessly some might consider it corny but i consider it classic filmaking and acting at its best one must remember when watching this film that europe was involved in a war with germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always conquer over evil gunga din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing escapades in short its a classic film that doesnt take itself too seriously and doesnt want the audience to either,1,1,positive,

casting jack cassidy as ken frankin was sheer brilliance cassidy personified arrogance confidence charm and wit all with a condescending evil little smirk on his face in my opinion jack cassidy is by far the best murderer having appeared three times in the columbo series this particular and first performance is my favorite columbo episode ever hands down a fresh faced steven spielberg did amazing camera work yes there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at timescapturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between columbo and franklin also the panoramic and tight in shots at big bear lake ca franklins cabin home were very impressiveif you have not yet seen this episode then you owe it to yourself to do so its a true masterpiecejack cassidy was a very talented actor and singer his charismatic personality was highly infectious his death in 1976 at age 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic he surely had his best years ahead of him rest in peace jack you will live on for eternity through your great work,1,1,positive,

when john singleton is on hes on and this is one of his better films not quite as tight as boyznthehood but close to it and with much of the same stellar cast this film was very well written very well put together and very well shot theres very little to criticize and most of my complaints are superficial eg where did fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff no mention of a rich background and why doesnt professor phibbs have an office a professor of his stature should have one and while were at it for an engineering student hick or not remys a pretty dumb character id think that hed have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence he talks and acts like a total buffoonbut that aside the film was very sharp a good array of characters and points of view and singleton doesnt take sides in the story many of the characters are unsympathetic and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sidesmuch of the cinematography was excellent i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well also the malikdeja scenes were really well shot as wellthe dialogue was a bit much at times this film had a tendency to get really preachy at times and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness we really didnt need the us flag with unlearn typed onto it give some credit were not morons and to top it off although most of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well sometimes it gets way too cheezy like dejas death which is fine until she screams out why which simply ruined the entire effect and scenebut the acting in general was top of the line fabulous performances by omar epps perhaps the best ive ever seen kirsty swanson who knew buffy could act michael rapaport surprised the hell out of meafter true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a onerole actor and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are always outstandingdownside jennifer connelly was flat though its not completely her fault her role was stereotypical and onedimensional generic to the highest degree and tyra banks who had the role was nothing short of horrid she whined and whined and whined yet another in the long line of modelsturnedactresses who failed miserably though there are a few who prove the exception to this rulefinally the soundtrack wow an amazing soundtrack which is definitely worth buying which fits the film like a glove each scene has a twin song although the tori amos songs started to really annoy me by the endnot her best work liz phair rage against the machine ice cubehow can one go wrongall in all a really good watch a really strong cast great script great film 810,1,1,positive,
as a film buff i obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny sarcastic comments about this film my favourite being woody allens quip if i had my life to live over again i wouldnt change anything except for seeing the musical remake of lost horizon therefore ive never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreographysetsongs etc just recently i came across a widescreen dvd and watched it for the first time in years along with a friend who had never heard of the films reputation he really enjoyed it and after trying to block out all the negative prejudices i obviously had about the film so did i there is nothing especially bad about lost horizon and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970s movies it isnt even especially camp the lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic but this isnt really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them as for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune this criticism falls apart since liv ullmann olivia hussey and peter finch were dubbed brilliantly too as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly and sally kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style vocally kellermans duet with olivia hussey on the things i will not miss is excellent special mention should be made of the legendary hollywood star charles boyers brilliant performance as the high lama and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to todays fractured world i wouldnt claim for a second that lost horizon is a masterpiece the things i wouldnt miss about it are the uninspired choreography and bobby vans question me an answer number which could easily have been cut but if you havent even seen lost horizon or havent seen it for some time try watching without that oh boy lets have a laugh at this pile of junk attitude and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is,1,1,positive,
have you seen the graduate it was hailed as the movie of its generation but a river runs through it is the story about all generations long before dustin hoffmans character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia norman maclean and his brother paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world but how could a place like post ww1 montana be a showcase for the american family at a time when the wild west still was not completely gone just what has maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves as the movie opens norman is an old man flyfishing beside a rushing river trying to understand the course his own life has taken the movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness against times current and back to when he was a boy he and his younger brother paul were the sons of a presbyterian minister and devoted mother the parents fit snugly into their roles mom takes care of house and home dad does the work of the lord the boys ponder what they will be when they grow up norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad given the choice little paul would be the boxer since hes told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesnt even exist the boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing they are at similar points in their lives before college but when norm returns from his six years at dartmouth things are very different paul is at the top of his game master flyfisherman grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life even as his father grills him about what he intends to do youre left feeling that at least to pops god will call you to your lifes work but you have to stay open and ready to receive it all your life father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate gods eternal words listen their father urges its both zen and quakerly pretty radical for a stoic clergyman but with all the beauty and contemplation and even though the macleans are truly a godfearing scriptureheeding household how is it that rev macleans family is unraveling paul is true perfection as he fishes the river but hes feeling the pull of gambling and boozing while his family doesnt know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed mom dad and brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they cant seem to help pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm but the junior brother is losing his grip norman starts getting his life on track finding love and career but paul continues to slide the family that loves him watches helplessly mother father brother flounder in their own ways trying to help but none very effectively how can a family that loves each other so much be so illequipped to handle this how can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in gods nature yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that gods peoples have made for themselves these are all questions norman will ponder his entire life the eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him yet keep their secrets the movie is beautiful to watch this is certainly gods country and filming it won an oscar director robert redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern hes presenting and it works well but do go back and read the book too youll see norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest and youll see the places where the storytellers very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it leading into the unknown,1,-1,positive,

the turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide there was no real suspense most of the characters were insipid the chesty irish priest was as lame as the love interest interest is misleading the girl that they chose to provide the films sensuality might be better the central conflict of the main character was uninvolving this film is entirely devoid of positives it is like a tedious exercise by someone who didnt want to go to the gym that day but did anyway,0,-1,positive,

the entire 1015 minute presentation is done in a very nonthreatening and nonmedical way that even preteen children can easily understand it dispels many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days 1946 while sex is not explicitly mentioned the part about fertilization is this is also purportedly the first hollywood production to ever use the word vagina in the dialogueit is cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day many of the betty boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either max fleischer was a bit of a card and did this with many of the betty boop cartoons which required framebyframe viewing to find themthere is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is in fact there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning kotex and kimberlyclark corporationthis title is nearly impossible to attain but for those who are bittorrent downloaders it can be found out there in the ether this is one of those keepers that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity,1,-1,neutral,

although the movie takes place at an ivy league college it was in fact shot entirely in northern arizona mostly at northern arizona university in flagstaff in the fall of 1976 i was involved in the theater department there and most of the extras in the film are thenmembers of the theater department there is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film if you know your arizona geography that shows several cast members riding bikes from the college to a creek we nauers know that the campus and said creek actually oak creek canyon are about 35 miles apart and while the trip there is all downhill it would be literally impossible to ride a bike back up that same road,0,-1,neutral,

val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific i have seen kilmer on the doors however his interpretation of john holmes is superb nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around at the same time the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed the movie deserves being watched more than once the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing,1,1,positive,
this is the funniest movie i have ever seen however i have laughed harder at plenty of movies this is because best in shows brilliance lies not in slapstick or oneliners but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit the improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke but only until after several jokes build on one another each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you cant help letting looseits a wellshot film but what makes it extraordinary is the acting i was impressed on my first viewing but when i watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised i was amazed it was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other build jokes out of nothing and completely immerse themselves in their charactersi imagine the golden days of second city were like this,1,-1,positive,

i wanted to like this movie i really really did i was so excited when i saw the preview which scared the hell out of me but when i saw the actual film i was disappointed the acting is stilted and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced and im sorry but a boy being chased by a turd in a bedpan is not funny or scary its just stupid i grew up on the bell witch legend so i know quite a bit about it a lot of facts in the movie are right on target but this film should have been much better the entire birthday party scene for example lasts about fifteen minutes adds nothing to the plot or the story and should have been left on the cutting room floor a more heavyhanded editor might have been able to get a decent film out of this messplease understand im not in any way shape or form involved with the other bell witch movie and im not trying to attack this imdb listing im just telling it like it is,0,-1,negative,

youll notice that the chemist who appears in two scenes and gets to speak is played by stephen king dont give up your day job is the standard thing to say but thats not fair king acquits himself reasonably well hes no worse than any other member of the cast and better than most the story on the other hand is pure rubbish please give up your day jobnever have i seen so many dreadful performances of which the lead actors the lead actors is probably the worst gathered together in the one film everyone acts hammily but not in any entertaining way they all somehow manage to go overthetop without expending or manifesting energy i blame screenwriterdirector tom holland it cant be that all the actors are really this bad what are the odds against that admittedly ive never heard of any of them before but still i dont think i could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if i tried one actor despite my best efforts would turn out to have talent so whats more likely that tom holland rolled a dozen consecutive snakeeyes or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly that would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script the more direction an actor got the worse he performed you want me to bend over like a hunchback talk from the back of my throat show all my teeth and look bored all at the same time okaythis theory is confirmed by the fact that holland undeniably managed to cowrite a lousy script several writers here have commented on the fact that billy halleck is not a likeable character but thats a misleading way of putting it hes not a knowable character all we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that hes fat and that all he can think about is food all i can think about is food he tells us helpfully and in the endsigh i suppose i ought insert a spoiler warning herein the end he becomes evil why i can only shrug perhaps hes under some kind of enchantment yeah thats probably it by evil perhaps i mean inexplicable its not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary meansend psychology anyway his actions at the end make no sense nobodys actions make much sense and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audienceby the way heres my nominee for hammiest linedelivery i dont think youd like it in fact big dramatic pause i dont think youd like it at all,0,0,positive,
riding giantsthis documentary traces the history of surfing and follows three other wellmade and acclaimed surfer films dana browns endless summer its followup endless summer ii by bruce brown danas son and step into liquid imax i saw the first not the others while the surfing footage is spectacular i valued most the filmmakers historic perspective he takes us back to the sports origins almost a hundred years ago and shows how it evolved to its present form this includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers how surfboard designs changed over time which beaches in hawaii and california were most frequented by the worldclass surfers and what an incredible adrenalin rush the sport provided them the athletes lived for months at a time on beaches surfed from dawn to dusk camped on rudimentary bunks fished for food and went back out on their boards the next day what a euphoric way to spend your youthful days we see how the media discovered and promoted the sport after a slow start what was the biggest boost to the sport believe it or not it was the movie gidget although i suspect copyright issues may prevent crediting the beachboys surfing songs like surfer girl and surfing usa the surfing magazine and encyclopedia of surfing who knew there was such a tome are mentioned for their contributions we also see commentaries from the pioneers of the sport their families and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s one such story is how 40year old laird hamilton considered todays greatest surfer bonded with an earlier leading surfer introduced him to his single mom who he married before becoming his stepdad a rousing musical background of contemporary music from all eras accompanies the story have i whetted your appetite wonderful have a great ride,1,1,positive,

joseph l mankiewiczs sleuth didnt need a remake its a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day however given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing i really cant say im surprised to see the film updated for modern audience the plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man milo tindle who goes off to see an older man andrew wyke to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older mans wife from there a game of cat and mouse ensues its clear right from the outset that director kenneth branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location which has been changed from the charming gamesridden country house of the original to a technical marvel kitted out with layers of security equipment im glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original plus theres the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at unfortunately however the positive elements of sleuth 2007 end therethe original film was over two hours long while this remake is only just a shade over eighty minutes naturally therefore that means that this version has less about it and unfortunately its the characters that suffer the plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place the film does not build the characters or the rapport between them enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense one major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be very important once the twists come into play here he has some kind of security fetish that doesnt really mean anything by the end kenneth branaghs handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there the original thrived on it but this film is happy merely to soil itself with expletives on numerous and mostly unwarranted occasions which cheapen the whole thing the final twist in the tale is completely different to how it was in the original and ensures that the film boils down to a really hideous conclusion after spending two hours with the original i understood respected and liked both characters presented in the film after eighty minutes of this i hated them both i do have some respect for branagh for not merely rolling out a carbon copy of the original film but this is not a good adaptation of the great anthony shaffer play,0,1,positive,

the italians are undeniable masters in the questionable art of ripping off and imitating movies what they do is take an innovative moneymaking and foreign concept maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action sleaze and political incorrectness but what to do when the nonitalian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy well then i guess you simply disregard everything in terms of storybuilding or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie this italian turkey was inspired by richard fleischers successful slaverysaga mandingo released one year earlier but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title you shouldnt expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth character drawings unsettling atmosphere or thoughtprovoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships mandinga is pure and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already the characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards which is of course to expect when youre dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in south america the elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower who probably also won a couple of moustacheoftheyear awards who exploits and extendedly whips the slaves working for him his mistress who if i understood correctly is also his cousin is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves when the plantation owners son returns from europe after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last the handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times even in front of the slaves supposedly to demonstrate how their masters do it but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preachers daughter his romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever hey i just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes mandinga sound like an interesting film well its not and i apologize if i raised anyones anticipations its an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through but if the themes appeal to you then definitely check out the aforementioned mandingo much rather than sick exploitation that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film with real actors great music and impressive filming locations mandinga has nothing absolutely nothing to offer,0,-1,positive,

slither is a horror comedy that doesnt really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other it has one scene that is exceptionally good any number of zingers that work but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie in addition the script does not focus on the hero and heroine and goes off kilter in several placesa major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero fillion to follow grant grant michael rooker as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster this whole part of the film drags michael rookers character isnt that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monsters interest might be interesting if this was grant portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horrorcomedy alien invasion movie in the final analysis this movies problems are in the script it isnt that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates the purpose of a horrorcomedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get an exploration of the aliens habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag the ostensible heroine elizabeth banks as starla grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the endwhen fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but once again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows and the characters should know that grant is not just suffering from some disease and act accordingly shotguns instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although their reactions might have been human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised delivered action a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing spoilers ahead after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien the writerdirector gunn chooses as this character a completely new character rather than one of already developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and money furthermore the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the aliens plans without all the additional characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigormy last criticism is based on the movies look gunn is primarily a writer or maybe it was budgetary constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field and the screen simply looks drab the sets in wheelsy the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office mojo states the films budget was 15 million newspapers say 29 million and considering they didnt use any name talent i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and rarely looks deadlythe last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the characters actions by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grantthe alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a local has been acting psychotic time to call the authorities but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and actalthough this movie is ostensibly a horrorcomedy the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story especially the entire morgan freeman subplot and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the main characters

this film had so much promise i was very excited about this film in the end it was laughable at best painful at worst the acting styles ran the gamut from really really flat the angels the wife and daughter to overanimated caspers character i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other pay special attention to the scene regarding the bug its pretty much an insult to the audiences ability to figure things out in defense of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations too bad they didnt make use of it i didnt feel like i was transported to exotic locations anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome however to end on a positive note i thought the sets were pretty good i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers it is my opinionand thats all it is that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased this film would have been good,0,0,positive,
for those whod like to see this movie id say go without the narration it might be a very good moviedocumentary but the music the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me following several animals their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap were watching but the melodramatic point of view just doesnt cut it for me moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey one exception left there the camera zooms out or skips to another scene i ask myself why that happens if they were to show reality why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd cause after all it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet,0,-1,neutral,

no this isnt a sequel to the fabulous ova series but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of ghim and the disappearance of woodchuck it is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series which is why characters namely orson and shiris are reintroduced and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the ova the booklet included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions as do various online sites the first eight episodes of this 27part tv series focus on the fateful battle at demon dragon mountain the remaining 19 episodes introduce us to spark a bluehaired knight wannabe who identifies with parn and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the dark wizard wagnard from resurrecting kardis the destroyerwhile it isnt quite the equivalent of the original lodoss war we all love the finale where parn saves deedlit from wagnard dont we this tv followup is still great fun for fantasy fans even if the animation is limited and a step down from the artistic streak of the first lodoss this 27part series has its elements of appeal the fullyrealized characters engaging storyline magic romance and a superb soundtrack scored by kaoru wada of ninja scroll all give this uneven spinoff some punchwhile the ova dub of lodoss has been criticized for one reason or another i generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite dubs so i had significant hopes for the dub for chronicles made in 19992000 for the most part the lodoss tv english track is of passable if not stellar quality it does however have its share of problems much of the original cast who lent their english voices to the characters of lodoss return including lisa ortiz as deedlit which is a nice bonus on the other hand billy regans more mature sounding parn is a bit offputting he doesnt do a bad job but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes causing some antidub fans to instantly diss the dub but by the time spark and company take the stage i found it less bothersome i dont know if its because he improved or if it just grew on me also not everyone from the oav dub returns jayce reeves only voices wagnard terrifically for one episode hes replaced by pete zarustica for the whole show who gives a scratchy but still malevolent turn as well as the expected evil laughter anthony cruises kashue on the other hand is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride oliver gregory is probably the most effective as orson especially during his final dramatic scenesaside from lisa ortiz deedlit karen smith shiris john knox ashram and al muscari slayn the dubs best voices come from some of the newer characters including crispin freeman spark maar garrack episodes 1627 roxanne beck little neese meg frances who voices pirotess in the oav but also voices ryna with vulnerability and sassiness as well as karla and especially angora deb who steals every scene shes in as leaf the halfelf the rest of the cast isnt terrible by any means but a little more uneven than the oav dub some are all right aldonova greevus while others are lackluster hobb palace guards dragons etc and few were awful in particular prince reonas va is too harsh and monotone for a fighter of justicein fact the lack of aural continuity some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes is one of the problems of the dub others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue uneven synchronization and finally i apologize in advance to the fans of this the lodoss island segments these offbeat superdeformed interludes at the end of each episode will either amuse or drive you batty admittingly i at first found them to be a major nuisance but they sorta grew on me after a while besides there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as im king kashue and this is my cashew im really quite a nut these flaws rank the dub for chronicles just a notch just below that for the ova resulting in an uneven english track summed up best as okif one wonders if the japanese language track is the preferred listening choice well guess what the japanese version has its good and bad points too while some voices are less annoying than the english language track i found others to be less appealing than the english equivalents in particular the actress who does deedlit is nowhere nearly as good as lisa ortiz or yumi tohma plus i should mention that the japanese cast is not the same as the ova because the series was made seven years after the original all but one sho hayami of the cast members are replaced by new ones although they do a respectably good job it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the japanese ova cast shows that not everything in japanese is better than english eh despite its flaws chronicles of the heroic knight is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground its not without its rough spots and doesnt always live up to its predecessor yet theres enough good points to counter the bad making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy anime,1,1,positive,
thats certainly a strange way to promote a film upon which a great deal rested and it seems like plain suicide on the part of the studio given that 1 the feuds between the cast were well known long before the movies release 2 the feud between the producerrobert fryer and director michael sarne was also common knowledge 3 the cast made no secret of their contempt for the film and made it public at every opportunity with daily bulletins from the set gleefully reported by gossip columnists everywhereand 4 the author gore vidal hated it practically from day one nevertheless that tagline just about sums it up raquel welch does give a decent performance as myra and she looks lovely besides john huston is very funny as buck loner the excowboy star who runs a phony acting academy mae west in her first screen appearance since 1943 naturally rewrote her part to suit herself and she is great as oversexed and thats putting it mildly talent agent leticia van allen still she must have wondered after waiting so long for a good vehicle in which to return how she ever ended up in this messtom selleck in his film debut is one of her clients john carradine and jim backus as doctors also amble in briefly rex reed as myron farrah fawcett and roger herren as the victims of myramyrons sexual passion are neither here nor there the same goes for the script which not only fails to focus on the basic plot of the book but seems to head in at least three different directions at once although wests part was originally larger she was reduced to a cameo role by the time sarne was through with the editing and partly because of this she seems to be in a different movie apparently at some point the producers realized that mae was going to be the films big draw and unable to replace most of her cut footage they rushed her back to the set at the end of filming for the second of her two songs both of which come out of nowhere the device sarne used of throwing in old film clips of bygone stars to emphasize whatever points he was making doesnt work at all by the time the movie concludes all a weary spectator can do is wonder what in the hell it was all about not surprisingly just about everyone connected with the production felt the same way and it died at the box office a technically flawless dvd includes among other extras separate commentaries from both welch and sarne each of whom have completely opposite opinions of just what went wrongno doubt its home video rerelease was prompted by a 2001 vanity fair piece which attempted in great detail to do the same thing true the structure of the novel made a screen adaptation a dubious undertaking but with sarne at the helm of what was obviously a troubled production it really never had a chance,0,1,positive,
private practice is supposed to be a medical drama so i guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines just by watching house i solved two out of nine medical mysteries before the doctors did boooring seriously if you are a lazy writer why not copy some cases out of older er episodes or some obscure brazilian medical soap house is recent and popular recycling their ideas is hard to get away withsecond biggest complaint these people are supposed to be fortysomethings right then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15yearolds is three weeks ie three whole damn episodes of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesnt want to be your friend with benefits its maybe not because he wants to hurt you but because he doesnt want to risk your friendship the character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you cant really buy into the supposed dramaand i wont even start complaining about what the show did to everyones favorite addison as we got to know her in greys anatomy on a sidenote dont you think its funny the way addison ends up lusting after loser pete sorry but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with mozarts requiem is a loser phd or not and derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny irritating meredith miles away in rainy seattle apart from that little fling with mark they seemed to be perfect for each other sometimes i think shonda rhimes subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships our first choice is often the right one,0,-1,positive,

a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on dantes inferno there is nothing especially clever dantes divine comedy was a brilliant piece of social commentary this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high arti suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political andor religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked be that as it may few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satirethe high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of schoolhouse rock on the subject of lobbying and the revolving door its really a shame that the entire film couldnt have been a musical that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun,0,1,positive,

you should not take what i am about to say lightly ive seen many many films and have reviewed a great deal of them in print so when i tell you that this film has the single funniest scene i have ever seen in a movie you might want to listen to me theres a lot of diversity of opinion as to what makes this incredibly stupid movie as funny as it is and to those who just didnt get well i cant blame them too much the scene i speak of comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict shackled to john candy up until that point i had found the film dumb confusing and it was beginning to lose me when this scene came up i laughed so hard i peed my pants no movie has ever done that to me before when the project began going berserk was supposed to be the sctv movie i remember it being announced as time went on the cast was whittled down to john candy joe flaherty eugene levy there also must have been a regime change at universal while it was being shot because upon being released it was shown in nearly zero theaters when watching this a second time i listened to the theme song which actually flaunts how incomprehensible the plot is in the lyrics relaxed my logic nerve and figured out what was going on aside from the aforementioned routine going berserk has many other hilarious scenes to recommend it this is almost a 3 stooges flick except its much funnier director david steinberg has razor sharp timing and he must have been laughing all through this as for candy whos basically in charge here he has never been funnier with all the plot devices and explanatory scenes thrown out the window he absolutely runs wild flaherty and levy follow him effortlessly there is a plot but its a plot like animal house had a plot and yeah the script is uneven and a little slow to start once you know this however you can well appreciate the full sctv style craziness that transpires it is stupid but its stupid on purpose and you need to remember that when you see it do see it and discover for yourself if it has the funniest scene of all time in it,1,1,positive,

i had read online reviews praising this obscure outing as a combination of gory horror quirky black comedy and borderline arthouse the film has elements of all three to be sure but they are at the service of such a supremely silly premise the title immediately gives the game away and amateurish production to boot that its longterm neglect due to a lack of proper distribution basically until cult epics picked it up for dvd release a full 30 years after its inception was no great loss to cinema or even the genres the bed was apparently created for the purpose of accommodating a demons dalliance with a woman anyway a dying man who had made use of the fourposter and even painted it ends up trapped in the wall behind the canvas and provides intermittent commentary to the action several people from teenagersonafling to gangstersinhiding supply fodder to the perenniallyhungry bed latest on the menu are a trio of girls one of whom however recalls its mistress of long ago and consequently the bed seemingly fears her seeing various objects from cigars to pieces of fried chicken and people getting swallowed up the belly of the bed is depicted as a vat of honeycolored liquid makes the film mildly amusing at times especially when a young mans hands are reduced to their skeletal formation which he seems to take rather too easily in his stride but also awfully repetitious so that at even a brief 77 minutes the whole pointless exercise feels strained and downright desperate,0,-1,positive,
